Please review and provide comments.\n\nTo summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:\n\n1.  Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.  Brett also\nforwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The\ncorrespondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings\nconducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and\nno claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the\nEntrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because\nthe downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.\nEnogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or\nQuestar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release\nthe gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo\nnegotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.\n\n2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really\nuseful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area\ncalled Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought\nthese assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately\nthis letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that\nposition with Wildhorse.\n\n3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.  I want someone intimately\nfamiliar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective\nto be involved.  We may need to seek a declaratory order.   We have run into\nto conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown.\nShould have this resolved on Monday.\n\n4.  Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the\ndeclaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.\n\nThis draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to\nreiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right\nto deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.  The fact that\nthe Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts,\nallows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in\ndefault."}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Joan Quick", "time": "2000-07-24T12:17:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Per the drafts, we are asking \"Wildhorse to accept all gas delivered.... upon\nstartup of the Treating Plant.\"   I thought the purpose of this letter was to\nget Wildhorse to take all of our gas right now, not just after the plant is\nstarted up.

Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the\nshut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification\nrelated to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed,\nEnogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have\nany historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims].\n\n B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment\nof Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure\nrequirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system\npressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse\nover the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the\nNWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased\npressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these\nproblems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 \"Gas Quality\" of the agreement,\nwhat remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?].\n\nHere's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and\nthe documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach\nnon-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to\nincrease gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of\nthis gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.  Then, they use\nthe downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive\nproducers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and\nquality issues discussed above.  Therefore, its critical that this letter\ngets to the \"right\" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference\nto some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable\nmanner, etc.).\n\nThanks.\n\nDan"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Gerald Nemec", "time": "2000-07-27T08:40:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Attached is the latest version of the Wildhorse Entrada Letter.

So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron\nAustralia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power\nderivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid\nout by the Government. These require \" that before entering into a contract\nwith a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia\nFinance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds:\n(a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and\n(b) that the counterparty is contracting on its own account.\"\n\nThis obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the\ncounterparty has an Australian presence or not.\n\nIn the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide\ncounterparties with an Enron Corp. guaranty. (Although this strict legal\nobligation\nprovision was deleted in July 1999.)\n\n Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist  was a\nprocedure to vet potential counterparties. We have procedures in place in the\nSydney office to do this. I understood  that this activity would still be\ndone in Sydney ie our list of 26 counterparties. the alternative was to\ndevelop procedures if it was to done else where.\n\nOn Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a\nscreen based trading system. (This is a legal requirement). Although unlikely\nthey may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties.\nI was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures.\n\nIn short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to\ncounterparties that do not have an Australian presence. The major sensitivity\nis taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being\ndirected outside Australia. On reviewing the subject this evening  I agree\nwith Chris Catts there does\nnot appear to be an issue. But I endorse Heidi's comment that now we know\nthat there could be non-resident counterparties (a first for us) lets close\noff the tax\nissue. I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT\nResources International Corp. GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an\nappropriate clause.\n\nHeidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris. We\ncould hopefully settle the words.\n\nIn the interim  I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory. David F if you must\nload GTCs Friday (Houston time) then I suggest we go with what we have. I\nwould ask for one small change.One small change though. Tana picked up one\npoint.

If he doesn't mind me\nwaiting to distribute the copies on the first break, I can take care of the\ncopying once everyone is seated and his talk begins.\n\nIf he chooses to have the copies ready first thing in the morning, please\nhave him request 55 (three-hole punched) copies to be charged to the\nUniversity of Waterloo's function.  If it's all right to hand them out\nlater, he can bring me the diskette when he comes down to the Stuart\nmeeting room on the third floor.  I will be there for registration and\ncontinental breakfast beginning at 8:00.\n\nPlease let me know which he prefers.\n\nThanks!\n\nAmy\n\nAt 11:10 AM 5/25/00 -0500, you wrote:\n>\n>Hi Amy:\n>\n>Just checking on a few last minute details.

Instead, =\nthis data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which i=\ns both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commis=\nsion proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would=\n no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-bas=\ned sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applica=\nble services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the pu=\nblic utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarter=\nly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of po=\nwer at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each publi=\nc utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its web=\nsite an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms=\n and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (=\nmarket-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service)=\n; and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based=\n power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar qua=\nrter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wis=\nhes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services su=\nch as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise=\n its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those servi=\nces.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplifi=\ncation of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\n=3D=3D=3D\nThis e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidenti=\nal and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Also, for what it's worth, our view is that you have\nnothing to lose by putting out the word that you've got a 14-day extension\non the $690 million.  It buys a little time if nothing else.\n\nPlease let us know what else we can do to help.\n\n===============================\n\nCNNfn-STREET-SWEEP-14\nEnron Analysis, CNNfn\n\n    THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL\nFORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n    CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Shares of Enron\n(Company: Enron Corporation; Ticker: ENE; URL:\nhttp://.www.enron.com/) losing steam again today. The stock closing\ndown $2.07 at $6 99 cents a share. A nearly 10-year low. Investors\napparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattled\nenergy firm. Joining us with more on Enron`s troubles is Floyd\nNorris, financial editor with ``The New York Times.''\n    Welcome to the program.\n    FLOYD NORRIS, FINANCIAL EDITOR, ``THE NEW YORK TIMES'': Thank\nyou.\n    ROMANS: This has been a fascinating story and stock to watch\ndevelop. First off, what is the latest that drove this stock down\nmore than 20 percent again today?\n    NORRIS: Well, yesterday, after the close, they filed a report\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as people studied\nit overnight, they were quite surprised. And it got worse this\nmorning. They disclosed that they have $690 million in debt. So\nthey may have to pay next week if they can`t either come up with\ncollateral, which will not be easy, or persuade the lenders to\nrenegotiate. And what was shocking about that wasn`t that the debt\nexisted, that was known, it was that they had to pay it so quickly.\nIt turns out, according to what people are telling analysts, that\nDynegy (Company: Dynegy Inc.; Ticker: DYN; URL:\nhttp://www.dynegy.com/), which agreed to buy them only a week or\ntwo ago, didn`t know about this. They had not told them,\napparently, Enron didn`t realize they had this problem.\n    ROMANS: OK, wait. There seems to be a lot of things that Wall\nStreet didn`t know was going on. And every sort of revelation is a\nbig blow to the stock. Who is watching what`s happening here and\nhow can there be so many surprises. That`s confusing to a lot of\nfolks who are following this.\n    NORRIS: Well, it`s-the fact Wall Street is surprised isn`t\nnecessarily surprising, but the fact that Enron seems to have been\nsurprised is surprising. They`ve had a lot of turnover. It\nreinforces the suspicion that Jeff Skilling, the chief executive\nofficer who quit in mid-year, and perhaps the treasury and chief\nfinancial officer, both of whom were ousted within the last month\nas this crisis grew, may have been the only people who really\nunderstood what was going on there; and that makes you wonder what\nelse might yet come out.\n    ROMANS: Well, what about auditors and what about the board\ngoverning this firm. And what about Ken Lay, I mean he is sort of\nthe statesman of the industry, isn`t he? and he`s running this\ncompany again?\n    NORRIS: Well, he`s back running the company. The suspicion is,\nand Lay denies it, he says he knows what`s going on, my suspicion\nis that he didn`t know the details. He trusted. He understood the\ncompany was overvalued, probably. This is a man who was taking out\nhundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock, exercising stock\noptions and selling stock. But I suspect he didn`t understand all\nof the details and now they are coming back to haunt him. The other\nthing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the\ncompany is burning through cash at an amazing rate. And Enron has\nnot really given us a good understanding of why they are burning\nthrough the cash that fast. But it raises questions about whether\nthe company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken\nover by Dynegy by next September. And, of course, the way the stock\nis trading, it`s obvious that a lot of people on Wall Street doubt\nthat deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through\non the announced terms.\n    TRACY EICHLER, UBS PAINEWEBBER: Floyd, my question regarding\nshareholder lawsuits. It seems like there`s some validity there.\nAny new news on the SEC investigation and the magnitude to those\nlawsuits?\n    NORRIS: There`s no news on the SEC investigation. There are, of\ncourse, huge shareholder lawsuits. They`re filed against Enron,\nthey`re filed against the current and former officers of the\ncompany. And they`re filed against Arthur Andersen, which audited\nthis company. The accounting regulators are already starting to\ncheck in again on Arthur Andersen, which used to be the class of\nthe accounting business and has had a string of recent\nembarrassments.\n    ROMANS: All right, Floyd Norris for ``The New York Times,''\nthank you so much for joining us .\n    NORRIS: Thank you.\n    TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR\nUSE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT WWW.FDCH.COM\n    END\n    (Copy: Content and programming copyright 2001 Cable News\nNetwork, Inc.

Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes\nAlberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not\nclearly categorized as \"money\" but more likely an \"account\".  Although\ncertain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including\n\"money\", \"intangibles\", which includes \"accounts\", cannot be perfected by\npossession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a\nwire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes \"money\".  Although\nit is not clear, the better view is that \"money\" means cash in hand and not\non deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate\nto various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken\nbut properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this\nseems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely\nunknowingly).\n\nAccordingly, to perfect the \"account\" a registration is likely required at\nthe PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.\n\nEven then, as an \"account\" is an \"intangible\" certain conflicts rules for\nperfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions\nprovide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the\njurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of\nits principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration\nmay be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance\nsearch would have to be done to see if there are competing prior\nregistrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,\nregistration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and\nlaw firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.\n\nLastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also\na creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit\nholding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.\n\nIn terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my\nknowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has\nrecently determined that \"money\" includes deposits that we are not aware of,\nand I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.\n\nPeter.\n\n   Carol St Clair                03/20/2001 07:45 AM\n\nTo: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Cook/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Cash Collateral In Canada\n\nPeter and Greg:\nOne of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral\nin Canada.

Further, an advance\nsearch would have to be done to see if there are competing prior\nregistrations.

This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will\nhave to be put in manually.\n\nThe reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple\nstripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently,\nEnronOnline can\nonly send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge\nmonitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently\ncleared out of the monitor.\n\nSince these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these\ntransactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL\ndescription below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes\nweekends. The \"Wkd\" is short for week days.)\n\nWe do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be\nprepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into\nthe cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple\ndates for these types of products.\n\nIf you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824\nThank you.\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT on\n05/23/2000 02:05 PM ---------------------------\nDale Neuner   05/23/2000 10:26 AM\n\nTo: David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron, Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer\ndeBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jason Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jason\nAlthaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: 24 x 5 Products\n\nWe are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow,\nMay 24th.\n\nThe Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas\ndesk.

My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.\n\nHere's a quick recap-\n\n$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.\n$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.\n$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc\n\nThe difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.\n\nOf this, $218 MM relates to-\n\n-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)\n-[$44] MM for 36\" pipe vs 30\" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.\n-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)\n-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition\n-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)\n-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)\n\nWe can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36\" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.\n\nThe remaining $109 MM comes under the category of \"identified risks\".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the \"escalation\" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust."}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Gadd, Eric EGADD", "time": "2002-02-26T14:58:50Z", "lang": null, "text": "We need to collect ACA surcharges from the shippers.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDonoho, Lindy\nSent:\tTuesday, February 26, 2002 4:55 PM\nTo:\tCentilli, James; Gadd, Eric\nCc:\tDoll, Jeanette\nSubject:\tRE: Sun Devil\n\nThis is my understanding too.

Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.\n\nThanks, BT\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLawner, Leslie\nSent:\tThursday, November 15, 2001 8:04 AM\nTo:\tTycholiz, Barry; Dasovich, Jeff\nCc:\tSteffes, James D.; Cantrell, Rebecca W.\nSubject:\tPG&E\n\nSteffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.

Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk=\n=20\nassociated with the transactions, Chris advised that there needed to be a=\n=20\nmark-up over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO.\n\nThe ATO issued TR 1999/1 in January 1999, which provides a safe-harbor for =\nde=20\nminimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai=\nn=20\nmonetary limitations.  Under the de miminis safe harbor, where the costs=20\nassociated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to=20\noffshore affiliates do not exceed A$500,000 in a year, the safe harbor=20\nmark-up of 7.5% may be available.  Paragraph 86 of the ruling sets forth th=\ne=20\nrequirements as follows:\n\n\"As mentioned in paragraph 77, the Commissioner will apply a similar=20\nadministrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and=20\nindirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated=20\nenterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $500,000 in a year.  The=20\npractice applies to all intra-group services supplied or acquired where the=\n=20\nrelevant cost limit is not exceeded.  Therefore, in some cases, it might be=\n=20\napplicable to all intra-groups services both supplied and acquired.  The=20\ntransfer prices that must be used, and the conditions for their use, are th=\ne=20\nsame as those specified in paragraphs 82 to 84.  As for the practice in=20\nrelation to non-core services, all taxpayers in a group must use the same=\n=20\nmark-up, for incoming and outgoing services, in respect of each foreign=20\njurisdiction, but the mark-up may vary from country to country, within the=\n=20\nlimits described above.\n\nExample\n\nAn Australian subsidiary of a foreign based multinational group receives=20\nmarketing and technical assistance from a foreign associate. No other=20\nservices are acquired by any Australian member of the group from its foreig=\nn=20\nassociated enterprises.  The total direct and indirect costs of providing t=\nhe=20\nservices to the Australian subsidiary for the year are $200,000.  As long a=\ns=20\nthe amount actually charged for the services is not more than $215,000 (or=\n=20\n$220,000 in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 83), the Commissioner=\n=20\nwould not require the taxpayer to establish an arm=01,s length price for th=\ne=20\nservices.\"\n\nBased on discussions we had late last summer, we thought that the A$500,000=\n=20\nthreshold could be met.\n\nTo my knowledge, the recent changes and proposed changes to the Australian=\n=20\ntax rules would not affect TR 1999/1.  Please let me know if you have seen=\n=20\nanything to the contrary.  Consequently, to my knowledge, we are still unde=\nr=20\nthese guidelines.  I=01,m not sure, David, what you mean by 100% being curr=\nent=20\npractice as stated in your April 18th e-mail.  I am guessing that you are=\n=20\nreferring to the services provided under the cost sharing agreement.  Under=\n=20\nthat agreement, office costs are being shared by Enron Australia Pty Limite=\nd=20\nand 3 other Australian entities.  Here, services are being provided to an=\n=20\noff-shore affiliate.  As a result, it appears that TR 1999/1 would require =\na=20\nmark-up.\n\nI will be happy to discuss this with you both at your convenience.\n\nBest regards,\nSusan\n\nDavid Minns\n04/18/2000 12:22 AM\nTo: Susan Musch/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Heidi Mason/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shari Stack@ECT=20\n\nSubject: Re: Revised Australian Services Agreement =20\n\nI've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was=20\nsettling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement.

Please give me a call on this.\n\nMike\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 08/08/2000\n09:04 AM ---------------------------\n\nDaniel Reck\n08/07/2000 06:34 PM\nTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: draft\n\nMike and Jeff:\n\nAttached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.  To\nreiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:\n\n1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the\nqualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be\nrequired to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling\napplications.\n\n2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find\nmonetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically,\nwe have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we\ncan shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in\nas 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the\nformer owner staying in the game.\n\n3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the\nequity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an\noperator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide\nthe monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we\nwill need to better understand the available insurance products.\n4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk\nbelieves that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over\nthe next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk\nwill buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere\nfrom $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are\nlooking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or\nmarketing agreements.\n\nThe economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as\nan equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect\n$30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity\norigination.\n\nCommercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure\naround the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether\nthis is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the\nlaw.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined\nin the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this\ndeal.\n\nOn the flip side, people have heartburn over \"spirit of the law\" issues and\nthose are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance\nto move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this\nweek whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment\nso far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\n\nRegards,\n\nDan"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Susan Scott", "time": "2000-10-11T04:14:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Barbara, here is my draft of a rehearing request.

Here's what we\nfound out...\n\nSteve's question:\n\nWhat economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New\nMexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us\nexpanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?\n\nWhat you're really asking here is \"What are the comparative economics of\nenergy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?\"  In this\nanalysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to\nconstruct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including\nenergy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations.\n\n Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines\nand tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct\nturnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile \"rule of thumb\" we use\nfor turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36\") high-pressure steel\npipeline.\n\nIn terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are\nthree (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1)\ntransformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the\nconductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This\nnumber is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on\nTranswestern's pipeline.\n\nThe most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission\nlines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission\nlines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an\nelectric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could\ntake anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of\nelectromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along\nwith other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in\nsecuring permits for right-of-way.\n\nIn short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be\ncomparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and\nelectric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric\ntransmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate\nreturns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.\n\nDrew's questions:\n\n1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts\nhis plant?\n\nFor purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired\ngeneration.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding\nwhere to site a new electric power plant:\n 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market\n 2. Water rights for turbine cooling\n 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local\nregulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)\n 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure\n\n2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various\nutilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much\nthe same all over?\n\nFERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of\nconduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and\nbetween other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.\nFERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission\naccess and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate\ntheir transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant\nfunctions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under\nFERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's\npretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with\nrespect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual\nstates, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of\nIndependent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for\nimprovement (and possible further FERC involvement).\n\n\"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a\nsingle pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of\nservice to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission\nservice.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate\ntransmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro\nforma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own\nwholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the\nfull recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred\nto serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use\nopen access to move to another supplier.\"\n\n3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy\nbundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.\nseparately)?\n\nIn my experience, there is no \"one size fits all\" formula or strategy.  For\nexample, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to\nsupplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out\nof several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground\nand dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged\nthe gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the\npurchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western\nU.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders\nare satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation\nto the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/\ntransportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics\nand secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas\nsupply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala\nCalpine.\n\n4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?\n\nLast December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional\nTransmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of\nOrders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker,\nOrder 2000 makes \"a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations\nfrom the influence of electricity market participants.\"  Therefore, Order\n2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the\nfunctional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization\nof the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional\nboundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of\nprivately-owned transmission companies.\n\nFERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order\ninitiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The\nOrder also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned \"public\nutilities\" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private\nutilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate\nthe needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally\nowned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer\nthe following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused\nby structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in\ntransmission grid management through better pricing and congestion\nmanagement, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities\nfor discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase\ncoordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8)\nfacilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate\nlighter-handed regulation.\n\nCritics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO\nformation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers\nfor case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved\nin order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel\nany transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance\nand incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of\nfurther consequences for the hold-outs.\n\nAs to the final part of the question (\"why should we care?\"), presumably, the\ndevelopment of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the\nefficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As\nFERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and\nutility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission\nsystem.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and\nthe ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately,\nsources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately\ncripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.\n\n5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?\n\nNatural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only \"kill\" gas-fired power plants in\nthose instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural\ngas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side\nmanagement or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly\nprohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace,\nparticularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel\nfor electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than\n5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give\nfuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu\nprice).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make\nthe installation of new electric generation based on anything other than\nnatural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand\nside management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting\nresource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in\noffsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable\nto comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the\nuse of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.\n\nSteven Harris\n10/26/2000 10:05 AM\nTo: Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron\ncc: Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\n\nSubject: Re: Electric Developments\n\nSince you are the \"expert\" in this area, I need to know what economics would\ndetermine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe\n3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to\ndeliver the gas to a power plant in California.

Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various\nutilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much\nthe same all over?\n\nFERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of\nconduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and\nbetween other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.\nFERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission\naccess and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate\ntheir transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant\nfunctions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under\nFERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's\npretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with\nrespect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual\nstates, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of\nIndependent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for\nimprovement (and possible further FERC involvement).\n\n\"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a\nsingle pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of\nservice to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission\nservice.

They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own\nwholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the\nfull recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred\nto serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use\nopen access to move to another supplier.\"\n\n3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy\nbundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.\nseparately)?\n\nIn my experience, there is no \"one size fits all\" formula or strategy.  For\nexample, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to\nsupplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out\nof several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground\nand dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged\nthe gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the\npurchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western\nU.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders\nare satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation\nto the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/\ntransportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics\nand secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas\nsupply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala\nCalpine.\n\n4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?\n\nLast December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional\nTransmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of\nOrders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker,\nOrder 2000 makes \"a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations\nfrom the influence of electricity market participants.\"  Therefore, Order\n2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the\nfunctional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization\nof the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional\nboundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of\nprivately-owned transmission companies.\n\nFERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order\ninitiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The\nOrder also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned \"public\nutilities\" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private\nutilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate\nthe needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally\nowned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer\nthe following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused\nby structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in\ntransmission grid management through better pricing and congestion\nmanagement, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities\nfor discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase\ncoordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8)\nfacilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate\nlighter-handed regulation.\n\nCritics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO\nformation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers\nfor case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved\nin order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel\nany transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance\nand incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of\nfurther consequences for the hold-outs.\n\nAs to the final part of the question (\"why should we care?\"), presumably, the\ndevelopment of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the\nefficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As\nFERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and\nutility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission\nsystem.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and\nthe ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately,\nsources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately\ncripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.\n\n5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?\n\nNatural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only \"kill\" gas-fired power plants in\nthose instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural\ngas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side\nmanagement or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly\nprohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace,\nparticularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel\nfor electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than\n5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give\nfuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu\nprice).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make\nthe installation of new electric generation based on anything other than\nnatural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand\nside management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting\nresource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in\noffsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable\nto comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the\nuse of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.\n\nSteven Harris\n10/26/2000 10:05 AM\nTo: Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron\ncc: Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\n\nSubject: Re: Electric Developments\n\nSince you are the \"expert\" in this area, I need to know what economics would\ndetermine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe\n3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to\ndeliver the gas to a power plant in California.

Here's what we\nfound out...\n\nSteve's question:\n\nWhat economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New\nMexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us\nexpanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?\n\nWhat you're really asking here is \"What are the comparative economics of\nenergy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?\"  In this\nanalysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to\nconstruct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including\nenergy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations.\n\n Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines\nand tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct\nturnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile \"rule of thumb\" we use\nfor turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36\") high-pressure steel\npipeline.\n\nIn terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are\nthree (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1)\ntransformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the\nconductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This\nnumber is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on\nTranswestern's pipeline.\n\nThe most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission\nlines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission\nlines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an\nelectric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could\ntake anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of\nelectromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along\nwith other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in\nsecuring permits for right-of-way.\n\nIn short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be\ncomparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and\nelectric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric\ntransmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate\nreturns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.\n\nDrew's questions:\n\n1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts\nhis plant?\n\nFor purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired\ngeneration.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding\nwhere to site a new electric power plant:\n 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market\n 2. Water rights for turbine cooling\n 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local\nregulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)\n 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure\n\n2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various\nutilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much\nthe same all over?\n\nFERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of\nconduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and\nbetween other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.\nFERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission\naccess and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate\ntheir transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant\nfunctions.

I\nhave been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am\nin Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called\n\"Rates/Regulatory Services.\"  Our working group will have about a dozen or so\npeople from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been\nselected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.\n\nThe Working Group members are:\nRay Alvarez\nSergio Assad\nRoy Boston\nMike Grimes\nKyran Hanks\nRita Hartfield\nNancy Hetrick\nTom Hoatson\nPaul Kaufman\nValeria Lima\nBob Neustaedter\n\nHaving this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related\nto rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share\nresources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of\nSteve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and\nconcretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have\na specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and\ndeliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy\npositions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed,\nidentifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring\nresources needed by the group.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position,\nlocation, phone, e-mail address, and \"area of expertise\".  We will assemble\nthis information in a roster to be distributed to the group.\n\nEarly in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an\ninitial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are\nmany time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired\ntime.\n\nAs a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me\nwhat you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster\nabove has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We\nwill compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and\ndistribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that\nfirst meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and\nthe proposed goals.\nPlease have your inputs to me by January 7.

Gray Davis\nclaims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May\n2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show.\n\nOf the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from\nthe October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC\nlacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent\nSystem Operator.\n\nThat leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could\npotentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks.\n\nTalks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in\nunpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC\nadministrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will\nlikely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis\nexpects.\n\nDavis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., \"with one goal,\nand that is to bring back $9 billion.\"\n\nNearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO\ndocuments show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,\nfor example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October.\n\nDavid Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general\nmanager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but\nconceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO.\n\nDavis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork\nfor the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from\ncorporate energy suppliers.\n\nBut during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press\nsecretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about\ngetting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated\nby FERC.\n\nDavis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators\novercharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds.\n\nState Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation\ninto Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on \"shaky\ncalculations.\"\n\nTo come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices\nreceived by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been\nexpected under competitive market conditions.\n\nThe ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at\ntimes about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices\nin the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with\nair-quality rules.\n\nThe ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern\nborder, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the\nfuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity.\n\nThe ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's \"Big Five\" power\nsuppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the\nconclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents.\n\nThe ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest\nutilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid\noperator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the\ndocuments.\n\nThe ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed\namounts between May 2000 and February:"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Jeff Dasovich", "time": "2001-06-26T09:32:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 06/26/2001 04:31 PM -----\n\n\tMichael Tribolet/ENRON@enronXgate\n\t06/26/2001 12:14 PM\n\n\t\t To: Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate, Lisa Mellencamp/ENRON@enronXgate,\nRichard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry\nKingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff\nDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc:\n\t\t Subject: FW: Article\n\nHere are the sellers and amounts\n\nAmerican Electric Power Service Corp.

Gray Davis\nclaims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May\n2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show.\n\nOf the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from\nthe October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC\nlacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent\nSystem Operator.\n\nThat leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could\npotentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks.\n\nTalks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in\nunpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC\nadministrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will\nlikely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis\nexpects.\n\nDavis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., \"with one goal,\nand that is to bring back $9 billion.\"\n\nNearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO\ndocuments show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,\nfor example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October.\n\nDavid Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general\nmanager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but\nconceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO.\n\nDavis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork\nfor the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from\ncorporate energy suppliers.\n\nBut during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press\nsecretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about\ngetting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated\nby FERC.\n\nDavis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators\novercharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds.\n\nState Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation\ninto Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on \"shaky\ncalculations.\"\n\nTo come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices\nreceived by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been\nexpected under competitive market conditions.\n\nThe ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at\ntimes about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices\nin the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with\nair-quality rules.\n\nThe ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern\nborder, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the\nfuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity.\n\nThe ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's \"Big Five\" power\nsuppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the\nconclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents.\n\nThe ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest\nutilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid\noperator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the\ndocuments.\n\nThe ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed\namounts between May 2000 and February:"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Staab, Theresa TSTAAB", "time": "2001-11-05T09:02:58Z", "lang": null, "text": "-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tFrank, Carole\nSent:\tMonday, November 05, 2001 10:02 AM\nTo:\tStaab, Theresa\nSubject:\tArticle\n\nhttp://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B49235843%2DCE2F%2D4B48%2D9F1C%2DCB5FEDF47C22%7D&siteid=mktw\n\nCarole C, Frank\nEnron Net Works\n\n713.345.3960 work\n713.446.9307 cell"}, {"mid": 3, "parent": null, "author": "Mellencamp, Lisa LMELLEN", "time": "2001-11-22T15:42:49Z", "lang": null, "text": "=20"}, {"mid": 4, "parent": null, "author": "Hyatt, Kevin KHYATT", "time": "2002-02-19T08:40:52Z", "lang": null, "text": "-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTaylor, Gina\nSent:\tFriday, February 15, 2002 4:20 PM\nTo:\tHarris, Steven; Hyatt, Kevin\nSubject:\tArticle\n\nI wanted to be sure you saw this.\n\nGina\n\nDevelopment of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted\n\n02/15/2002\nPR Newswire\n(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)\nHOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004.\nBoth KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market.\nPhase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California.\nBased in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com .\nKinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects."}], "summary": "Federal energy regulators can only order refunds for a third of the $9 billion that California Governor Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state.

However, there is no contractual limitations period in the Marketing Agreement.  So, Enron would have four years to file suit against Philchem.  All this is largely academic, of course, because another provision in the Enron/Philchem Marketing Agreement basically amounts to a waiver of subrogation against Philchem.\n\n\tThe alleged one-year limitation period that confused Sharron West is a purported contractual limitations period/mandatory arbitration clause contained only in the Philchem/Baytank Terminalling Agreement.

Hackney indicated there would be a revised\n\"principles\" piece before long, so maybe we'll just have to wait. They do\nhave some legitimate concerns - if they're going to invest in distribution\nsystem upgrades, they need to know what's going to stay in ratebase and\nwhat's going to be competitive. There is a danger that the rules will\nremain so murky that nothing will get done by anyone - something akin to a\nreluctance to invest in generation so long as the ISO screws around with\nmust run contracts and congestion management schemes. We would probably all\nbenefit by knowing what the rules are going to be going forward.\nOn the other hand, it's hard to believe that SCE and the others don't want\nto nail down everything in sight for themselves. However, there appears to\nbe a growing understanding that the farther they try to reach, the more\nuncertainty they produce - they can't have it both ways.\nSooner or later there is going to have to be some consensus on what stays\nregulated and what goes competitive. Don't know what you think the chances\nare that it will be sooner, but at least it seems SCE is indicating a\nwillingness to engage in meaningful discussions that I haven't seen before.\nRich\n\nAt 01:32 PM 3/1/00 -0800, Scott Govenar wrote:\n>You are absolutely correct Rich.

Here are some answers to your\nquestions.\n\nWaskom is a field in East Texas (Harrison County) where we purchase gas from\nPennzEnergy at the Bryson C.P. and Jeter #2 wells.  The gas is termed up to\nNew\nWaskom Gas Gathering (NWGG) through June 2001 (the term of the PennzEnergy\npurchase).  We then buy the gas back from NWGG into our Tetco East Texas pool\n... also termed up through 6/01.\n\nVirginia Field used to be associated with NGPL, but several years ago\nPennzEnergy worked out a processing arrangement with Corpus Christi Gas\nGathering, so the gas is now termed up with CCGM through 6/01 ... priced off\nof\nthe Houston Ship Channel.\n\nJennings Ranch used to flow into NGPL through a gathering line, but a couple\nof\nyears ago NGPL sold that line to Midcon Texas, so we now handle it as another\nMidcon Texas property.  Sometimes we sell it at the meter to Midcon Texas\n(KN),\nand sometimes we ship it through Midcon to our NGPL South Texas pool.\n\nCarthage:  Altra picks up their gas in their Cartwheel agreement.  The\nagreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement.  It is not much\ndifferent than a Hub agreement, except it allows title tracking.  TGT on the\nwhiteboard refers to Texas Gas ... East Ohio takes their gas into Texas Gas on\na couple of different transport contracts.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions.\n\nDavid"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Peggy Hedstrom", "time": "2000-05-01T09:18:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal\n(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as\nKathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.\nKevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and\nI think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.

Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where\nand whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for\nair/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and\nour groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we\nreally need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in\nbooking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else\nif they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle\nyour travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow\nyou to spend more time on more productive endeavors!\n\n2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be\napproved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.\nYour Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to\napprove/sign them before going upstairs for approval.\n\n3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for\nDirectors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be\nwritten, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes\nfor filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this\nFriday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and\nboth the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC\nas of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback\nover the next week.\n\n4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is\nextremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything\npossible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as\nfollows:\n\nOzzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska\nJeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG\nBruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano,\nEPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC\nGil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN\nLaura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals\nBen Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site\nBank, Coal Plant development\nEd and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure\n\nWe're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy.\nThe above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very\nwell coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to\nclosure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll\npersonally handle them.\nThere are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft.\nPierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein,\nVNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and\nmany others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.\n\n5.)

I am\ncontacting you to request your assistance. We have recently had a very\ninteresting paper submitted for publication, entitled: \"Let's Swing Again\n(Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options)\".  I would very much like you to\nact as an anonymous referee for this submission, if it is not too much\ntrouble.\n\nKeypoints:\nAn expectation model with permanent and temporary shocks has been developed\nand used to price a swing option (capacity reservation option) on a\nnon-storable commodity. The model is a hybrid of a permanent shock (binomial\ntree) and temporary shock model (reminiscent of Black (1976)). The\nflexibility offered by the model's hybrid nature allows it to capture the\nempirical behaviour of electricity and gas prices: transient spot price\nshocks and calibration  to the futures prices and the futures volatility\nterm structure.  As the size of the volatility of the temporary shocks is\nincreased the component of the swing option priced derived from the\ntemporary shocks quickly dominates the component from the binomial model.\nTherefore, a failure to model the transient shocks when pricing swing\noptions may present a serious modelling error.\n\nI do hope that you are able to help us out. If you are in agreement, I can\nemail you the paper immediately - we would need the report emailed to us\nwithin around four weeks. Please get in touch as soon as possible.\n\nMany thanks for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPaolo Cadoni\n\n__________________________________________________________\nDr Paolo Cadoni\nTechnical Assistant, Risk Magazine\nRisk Waters Group\nHaymarket House                         e-mail: pcadoni@riskwaters.com\n28-29 Haymarket                          Tel.: +44 (0)20 7484 9804\nLondon SW1Y 4RX                       Fax: +44 (0)20 7930 2238\n\nThe information contained in this communication is confidential and may be\nlegally privileged.

The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well.\n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored.\n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68.\n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs.

Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people.\n\n\tThrough all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62.\n\n\tThere is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars.

Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game.\nIn the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people.\n\n\tThrough all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob.\n\n\tWe raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday.

Currently in the lead is Robert Vargas, with only 6 games missed. No one else had 6 wrong, while Carter Ellis was the only one with 7 wrong. Robert picked Denver tonight, while Carter picked Oakland.

(ENE), according to utility executives gathered for a national power conference here this week.\n\nEven as they nervously tracked Enron's stock plunge during coffee breaks Tuesday on their Internet-enabled wireless devices, and lunchtime chat Wednesday turned to the prospects for additional downgrades of the company's debt, executives mostly said they're merely evaluating their relationships with Enron at his point, while hoping for the best.\n\nAfter losing more than two-thirds of their value over the past two weeks and falling to their lowest level in a decade, Enron shares rose Wednesday for the first time since Oct. 16, gaining $2.74 to $13.90.\n\n\"We're very interested in their recovery,\" said David Rozier, senior vice president at Mirant Corp.'s (MIR) Mirant Americas Inc., noting that the demise of such a large player could have a ripple effect on markets. \"We're looking at that situation very carefully.\"\n\nAquila Inc. (ILA), which does a significant amount of trading with Enron, likewise \"would be reluctant to make changes\" to that relationship, said Steve Magness, executive vice president in charge of strategic partnerships. \"We would not change due to perception, only for financial reasons.\"\n\n\"We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties (in trading),\" added Aquila Senior Vice President and General Manager Brad Nordholm. Should Enron lose its investment-grade rating status, that would affect Aquila's continued willingness to trade with Enron, he said.\n\nMoody's Investors Service Inc. on Monday downgraded its rating on Enron's senior unsecured debt to Baa2 from Baa1, placing its rating two levels above noninvestment grade, and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade. Moody's said the downgrade was based on deterioration in the company's financial flexibility following an announced large quarterly loss and reduction of shareholder equity.\n\nAdditional unease has been created by reports about a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into certain financial transactions involving Enron.\n\nEuropean trading partners reportedly are taking a harder line with Enron than U.S. companies, which some here said could be due to foreign companies having less interest in the strength of markets here.\n\n\"Still, we want to trade in stable markets. We don't want to see any major long-term problems,\" said Trevor Pethick, director of trading with Powergen PLC's (PWG) Energy Trading unit. His company, like its U.S. counterparts, is \"reviewing our situation with Enron,\" he said.\n\nCoral Energy, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, continues to trade with Enron, although debt downgrades do lead Coral Energy to make changes to their business relationships with any trading partner, said Jeff Beicker, senior vice president of trading.\n\n\"I'm not seeing people saying, 'Let's save Enron' or 'Let's pounce on Enron.' It's business as usual,\" said Beicker. \"The market capitalization is where they're getting hammered.\"\n\nHe and Aquila's Magness, answering questions from conference goers following a presentation on risk management, downplayed the possible impact of such a large trading company as Enron going out of business. Both said they would expect more alternative trading platforms to EnronOnline to emerge quickly and fill any trading voids.\n\nBeicker further predicted that should Enron go under, trading margins would grow and companies would have to pay more going forward \"for warehousing their risk.\"\n\nThe Worldwide Business Research Power 2001 conference continues Thursday at the Camelback Inn resort in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nGenerators say state manipulating power market - They accuse the IPO of sharing inside information with the water agency.\n\nSACRAMENTO -- The state Department of Water Resources is demanding and getting privileged information from the state's electricity grid operator that, power generators say, is being used to illegally manipulate the energy market.\n\nThe role reversal - in which power generators are now accusing the state of violating federal laws to manipulate the market - was at the center of two depositions taken Wednesday by a Senate committee investigating the California energy crisis.\n\nThe Department of Water Resources in January started buying energy for the state because the private utilities weren't able to pay their bills and lawmakers feared rolling blackouts would ensue.\n\nOn Wednesday, officers with the Independent System Operator - which schedules electricity onto the state's power grid - told the special Senate committee that the Department of Water Resources buyers have been threatening since spring to stop buying unless they are provided with exclusive information about the grid.\n\n\"We have heard indications that if we failed to provide information, we may not have the backing,'' an ISO vice president, Jim Detmers, said.\n\nHe said the information includes the amount of electricity the ISO is short in what is called the hour-ahead market. The sharing of this same type of information among private generators last year led to accusations of gouging from state officials.\n\nWater Resources spokesman Oscar Hildago said the information is only used to ensure the buys are a justifiable use of taxpayer money.\n\n\"We have to stand behind those purchases, and the law, AB1X, did not give us the authority to write a blank check to (the ISO),'' he said, referring to the bill that put the state in the power business.\n\nState Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the special committee, said the state is now being accused of using privileged information to schedule controversial, high-priced long-term energy contracts the state secured in the early days of the crisis.\n\n\"The allegations from the generator community have been that DWR has wrested control of the wholesale market from ISO and they did so for purposes of dumping the long-term contracts into the market when there is lower-priced electricity available,'' said Dunn.\n\nIn an Oct. 18 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, power generators say that this is a violation of the regulations with which the operators must comply.\n\n\"Acting on behalf of the State ... the highly politicized (ISO) is engaged in an organized, deliberate effort to subvert the market mechanisms established by the commission,'' the filing reads.\n\nHildago countered: \"Quite frankly ... the louder they scream that something is unfair (that) is a measure of the success we have.\"\n\nISO officials go public with testimony\n\nTwo members of the state's electric grid operator chose to give depositions to a Senate committee in public Wednesday despite a Senate resolution calling for them to be kept secret.\n\nThe committee wanted the secrecy to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming public, according to its chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.\n\nBut Dunn said recently that those subpoenaed to testify could choose to do so in public.\n\nOn Wednesday, two officials from the California Independent System Operator took him up on the offer - Elena Schmid, vice president of communications and strategic development, and Jim Detmers, vice president of operations.\n\n\"We're an organization that's all about openness,\" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. \"It's part of our culture to want to open things up.\"\n\nThe testimony, she said, \"served the purpose of going back in time and looking at the many factors that contributed to the crisis.\"\n\nOther energy officials will also ask the committee for public depositions, she said, including the president and chief executive officer, Terry Winter, who is scheduled to appear Tuesday.\n\nThe Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market issued 16 subpoenas to current and former board members and staff of the grid operator.\n\nBut Winter's testimony will be of particular interest. The actions he took Dec. 8 to lift a price cap on wholesale energy cost is at the heart of the committee's investigation.\n\nDunn says Winter failed to tell the ISO board or other state officials about his request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift the $250-per-megawatt hour cap. It was replaced with a soft cap requiring generators to justify their costs above $250.\n\nA Senate resolution approved in July spelled out the ground rules for the depositions, saying no one could be present except members and staff of Dunn's committee, the person taking the deposition, an official report, the person being deposed and accompanying counsel.\n\nBut some have questioned the secrecy, saying it could make the testimony prone to manipulation.\n\nIn response to questions from the committee's special counsel, Laurence Drivon, Detmers testified Wednesday about the unraveling of the electricity market in the days leading up to Dec. 8, with dispatchers scrambling every hour to find enough power to keep the lights on.\n\n$1 million to fight S.F. public power / PG&E Corp. against city ballot measures\n\nThe corporate parent of PG&E, the bankrupt California utility fighting for financial recovery, has pumped more than $1 million into a campaign to defeat a pair of public power measures on Tuesday's ballot in San Francisco.\n\nCompany representatives say they want to protect their assets in the city, where there are 365,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers. Independent experts say more is at stake.\n\n\"I'm sure they don't want to see a snowball effect where other cities try to turn them out,\" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 's Energy Institute.\n\nBorenstein noted that Los Angeles, the state's largest city, had long been in the public power business. So has Sacramento and a number of smaller cities, such as Alameda and Palo Alto. PG&E serves 4.7 million customers in the state.\n\n\"If you're looking at a major movement, San Francisco is the biggest location where this is being discussed now,\" Borenstein said yesterday.\n\nSan Diego and San Jose also have been looking at putting their electrical system under public control, but have yet to take action. In San Francisco, two measures on the ballot would pave the way for a publicly owned electricity system.\n\nMeasure I would set up an independent municipal utility district for San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, governed by state law. Proposition F would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and retain ties to City Hall.\n\nIn both cases, elected directors would decide whether to seize PG&E's transmission and distribution lines.\n\nPG&E has said it isn't interested in selling, and for decades has fought at City Hall and in court to derail such efforts in San Francisco. But last winter's energy crisis shifted public attitudes and a more liberal Board of Supervisors pushed the public power proposals forward.\n\nStill, PG&E vigorously opposes the effort. Campaign finance reports show PG&E spent $1,023,289 through Oct. 20 to defeat the measures. How much more money the company has poured into the campaign since then will not be made public until after the election.\n\nOther business interests gave nearly $400,000 more through Oct. 20 to fight the ballot measures. The contributors include Pacific Telesis Group ($100,000) and AT&T ($150,000). The companies fear the creation of a MUD would lead the new agency's directors to try to take over the phone and communications operations, too. The Committee on Jobs, a big business group funded in part by PG&E, gave $110,500.\n\nThe money has paid for campaign consultants, mailers, slate cards, polls, phone banks and TV ads.\n\nPG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Ramp said the spending was warranted.\n\n\"It's perfectly natural that any company -- bankrupt or not -- facing a hostile takeover would fight the measures and get the word out to people that this is not going to solve the energy crisis,\" Ramp said.\n\nShe added the money used in the campaign did not come from the utility but from its corporate parent company.\n\nRoss Mirkarimi, who runs the public power campaigns, was more blunt in his assessment of PG&E's campaign contributions.\n\n\"They are going to do everything they can to preserve their monopoly and greed,\" he said.\n\nThe campaigns in favor of Proposition F and Measure I raised a little more than $90,000 through Oct. 20. Bay Guardian newspaper publisher Bruce Brugmann and his wife, Jean, gave $10,500. The weekly paper, which has long crusaded for public power, provided an additional $38,000 in free advertising. The Vanguard Public Foundation donated another $10,000."}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-02T07:29:30Z", "lang": null, "text": "Consumer Group To Ask Judge Fri To Block SoCal Ed Deal\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nPOWER PROBLEMS\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 1, 2001\n\nCalif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 1, 2001\n\nConsumer Group To Ask Judge Fri To Block SoCal Ed Deal\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A consumer group is expected to submit formal arguments Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles that a deal struck between California regulators and Southern California Edison to keep the utility out of bankruptcy violates state law.\n\nSan Francisco-based The Utility Reform Network succeeded Tuesday in temporarily blocking the settlement between the California Public Utilities Commission and the Edison International (EIX) unit, which would allow Southern Californa Edison to use $3.3 billion of ratepayer revenue to pay its bank debts and electricity costs, after receiving a temporary stay of the deal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals instructed TURN to argue for a permanent stay in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and delayed the settlement from moving forward for two weeks. The consumer group is expected to argue the deal between the PUC and the utility should be voided because it was reached during two weeks of secret negotiations and because it violates state laws requiring decisions on ratemaking matters to be conducted through public hearings.\n\nTURN attorney Mike Florio said the deal unfairly requires the utility's customers to pay higher electricity costs to help the utility pay off its debt.\n\nEdison executives said the utility expects to pay off its creditors during the first quarter of 2002, but the company agreed if TURN succeeds in delaying the settlement agreement the utility would be unable to pay its creditors next year.\n\nGil Alexander, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, said the utility will respond to TURN's arguments Tuesday. U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Lew, who earlier this month rejected TURN's arguments calling the deal \"fair,\" will hold a hearing on the matter Friday morning and is expected to rule at that time, according to Lew's court clerk.\n\nThe 9th District Court of Appeals said if TURN doesn't receive a favorable ruling from Judge Lew, the group can argue its case in the 9th Circuit, which Florio said it would do if it fails to block the deal.\n\nAlexander said Southern California Edison will argue that the settlement, ending a year-old lawsuit brought against the PUC, \"is very important and meaningful for shareholders and our customers.\"\n\n\"We will argue that it is very important for there to be no permanent stay and for the appeal to fail because it takes California back toward no resolution and creates further chaos,\" he said.\n\nSouthern California Edison became insolvent this year because state law prohibited the utility from passing on skyrocketing electricity costs to its customers.\n\nSeparately, TURN and other California consumer groups urged Attorney General Bill Lockyer this week to reconsider a decision his office made last month that consumer groups had \"no legal basis for objection or opposition\" to the Southern California Edison, California Public Utilities Commission settlement.\n\nPOWER PROBLEMS\n\nThe response to terrorist attacks in New York and Washington has understandably pushed a lot of other important public matters out of mind, but a case can be made that some of them deserve renewed attention not in spite of the attacks, but because of them. Power generation is among them.\n\nEarlier this year, the agency that runs New York's power grid made a persuasive case that the state needs to bring another 8,600 megawatts of power on line in the next four years to avoid the kind of power shortages that befell California . All that has changed is the urgency: New York's economy has faltered, making it all the more difficult to attract industry to a state where electric rates are exorbitant, while the arrival of foreign terrorism has raised concerns about the security of existing power plants.\n\nWhat stands in the way is a plant-siting bureaucracy that recently stretched out approval of a Greene County plant to more than two years, a year longer than law allows. It's an agonizing process that serves mainly to discourage potential investors from even thinking of building a plant in this state, especially as it compares to more streamlined processes in neighboring states such as Connecticut, which gets the job done in six months.\n\nAmericans have depended on easy access to electricity for decades, but with the advent of the microchip and all that it has produced - from computers to cell phones to remote controls - our reliance has increased.\n\nNew York barely had enough power available to get through the peak- usage times of summer. While the weakening economy may actually serve to decrease demand for a time, that slackening should be viewed not as an excuse to delay, but as a grace period that may help the state meet demand for electricity while increasing the available supply. Use may or may not decline during this economic slowdown, but sooner or later, it is bound to rise.\n\nSome advocates of a speedier siting procedure see signs of hope, largely because the issue seems to have riveted the attention of the Public Service Commission, which is the lead agency in the approval process. Still, nothing concrete has happened to suggest that the regulatory bottleneck has been opened enough to allow an efficient and careful routine to be established.\n\nGiven the need - to protect existing supply, to improve economic prospects for the future and to ensure a steady supply in the event of any kind of interruption - the state needs to be sure this matter does not short-circuit during this time of stress.\n\nCalif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the state's general fund and banks for power purchases made this year.\n\nDelays in the bond issue, originally planned for May, may deepen the state's budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the state's credit ratings.\n\n\"At this point, we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale,\" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\nThe PUC refused earlier this month to pass a so-called rate agreement, which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid, because it would give the the state's power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC.\n\nIn addition, PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governor's office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in long-term power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market. One of the commission's objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced, overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade.\n\nSo far, neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate. Spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), have said they haven't been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals.\n\nWilliams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts, but only if the result would benefit both parties. Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts, but the company is willing to talk with state officials.\n\nThe PUC met with members of Gov. Gray Davis' staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts, and talks are ongoing, Cohen said.\n\n\"We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts,\" Cohen said. \"We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish, what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price. My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations.\"\n\nSteve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor's office had no comment on the renegotiation talks.\n\nDavis has been criticized for entering into the deals at to high a price just before the spot market for power collapsed. His staff defended the contracts, saying they brought stability to the spot electricity market and helped bring down prices.\n\nThe parties haven't identified which contracts should be renegotiated, Cohen said.\n\n\"We're trying to figure out what we want to achieve, how many megawatts we want, and for how long, and at this point I don't know the answer,\" Cohen said. \"It seems like to start off and just pick one to renegotiate will not be effective. We need a plan.\"\n\nCohen said he cannot predict when renegotiations will take place, but the PUC is \"pretty far along\" in its analysis.\n\nA new rate agreement could be passed in a month, but the PUC is \"aiming to have everything done by January related to the bond sale,\" Cohen said."}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-02T13:21:45Z", "lang": null, "text": "Calif Generators Say State Still Dodging Its Power Bills\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nUSA: Stung Californians not crowing at Enron's troubles.\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nEnron Portland Genl Sale Seen Going Smoothly This Time\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nUSA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nIndia ONGC Plans Enron Oil,Gas Field Bid If BG Deal Fails\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 2, 2001\n\nCalif Generators Say State Still Dodging Its Power Bills\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California power generators have complained to federal regulators that despite recent assurances, the state has yet to provide credit guarantees for electricity sold through California 's wholesale power market and is deliberately delaying payment for hundreds of millions of dollars in past power sales.\n\nIn a filing this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, generators accused the California Independent System Operator, the state's wholesale market administrator, and the California Department of Water Resources, the state's power-buying arm, of engaging in a \"shell game\" to keep power flowing for free, despite a FERC order that payment be guaranteed.\n\n\"It appears that the ISO's refusal to implement settlement and billing procedures consistent with the orders is simply part of a shell game to avoid compliance with those orders,\" the generators said in their filing. \"This must be put to a stop.\"\n\nThe filing - by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) - is an attempt to pressure FERC to hold hearings on the issue, one of the generators in the complaint said. The parties also want FERC to order the ISO to bill the water department for the power they've supplied.\n\nA FERC spokesman said the commission is looking into the complaints and expects to meet on the issue sometime in November.\n\nAt issue is power sold through the California ISO, which is primarily responsible for keeping supply and demand in balance on the grid but which also operates a wholesale market to buy and sell power for that purpose.\n\nThe state has paid $9 billion for electricity purchased directly from suppliers, but it has yet to pay at least $1.2 billion for last-minute power, reserve capacity and other services supplied to the ISO since January. The ISO has yet to bill the DWR for those services, both parties agree.\n\n     Williams Has Booked Revenues\n\nAssurances by California earlier this month that it would back those power sales and work out the unpaid debt led Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in revenue from previous ISO power sales in the third quarter.\n\nWilliams, which said it filed a separate complaint with FERC that \"dovetails\" with the other generators' filing, said it continues to believe it will be paid for the power sales it booked.\n\nDuke said it has taken reserves covering all its exposure to the ISO. Dynegy and Reliant said they have also taken reserves. A Mirant spokesman couldn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ISO and the California Department of Water Resources, the agency handling the state's power purchases, denied there is any deliberate effort to keep generators from getting paid. Instead, complicated accounting and confidentiality issues have made it impossible for the ISO to bill the DWR for the purchases, delaying payment, they said.\n\n\"Basically we can't send a bill to the DWR because it would include information that we're not supposed to share with other market participants,\" ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said. \"Unless the DWR can get permission from the suppliers, and it is my understanding that they have not been able to do that, we are between a rock and a hard place in our ability to provide the information needed to settle.\"\n\nThe DWR wants a breakdown of individual transactions. The ISO, however, is prohibiting by federal rules from sharing confidential market information with other market participants unless the parties agree.\n\nOscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the DWR said the agency attempted to obtain approval from generators to have the ISO release the electricity sales data, but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nThe ISO has been working on a settlement procedure, but the parties can't agree on a single solution, Fishman said.\n\n\"There are potential solutions out there, but not one that everyone can agree to,\" Fishman said.\n\nGenerators called the claims ridiculous.\n\n\"The ISO is bound to bill, and the CDWR is bound to pay for these ISO purchases,\" they said in the filing.\n\nIn April, FERC ordered the ISO to find a creditworthy backer for power purchased to serve utility customers. In various filings, the ISO indicated the DWR was filling that role.\n\nIn mid-October, the DWR spelled out which power purchases it would back. The generators criticized that list as incomplete.\n\n\"Our understanding is the DWR picked up net short and they are responsible to pay for the net short,\" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, a trade group representing power suppliers that also filed a complaint this week with FERC. \"A significant amount of money is in arrears, and we still have this 'Who's backing what' game.\"\n\nUSA: Stung Californians not crowing at Enron's troubles.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - If there's one market that might applaud the mounting financial woes facing energy giant Enron Corp., it's California , whose power sector was shattered by the market deregulation that Enron tirelessly champions.\n\nLast summer, angry Californians tossed a pie at Enron ex-Chief Executive Jeff Skilling during a speech here in which he blamed state regulators for causing the energy crisis.\n\nCalifornia officials, led by Governor Gray Davis, blasted Houston-based Enron and other out-of-state power companies for creating the emergency, accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices.\n\nBut with Enron now facing a credit crunch and a full-scale probe by U.S. regulators into questionable financial dealings, California officials are holding back their harshest criticism, saying instead there are lessons to be learned from Enron's predicament.\n\nAnd some of Enron's toughest critics, among them Davis and Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), would not discuss the company's woes.\n\n\"You reap what you sow, but I don't think anyone wants to pile on them right now,\" said a state government source.\n\nMany Californians cited ongoing business and creditor links with Enron as reasons not to hurl stones at the energy giant.\n\nEnron is by far the nation's largest trader of electricity and natural gas, with energy analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets.\n\nTransactions on the company's widely watched Internet-based EnronOnline trading system are estimated currently to average $3 billion to $4 billion a day.\n\n'BUSINESS CYCLES'\n\n\"Business cycles come and go,\" said Greg Pruett, spokesman for San Francisco-based energy company PG&E Corp. , whose Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California 's biggest utility, filed for federal bankruptcy protection in April in the wake of the energy mess.\n\n\"We are wrestling with our own situation, and you can appreciate what Enron is going through. We have done business with Enron for a long time and will continue to do business with them in the future,\" Pruett said.\n\nCalifornia 's power agencies, forced into buying emergency electricity for the state earlier this year when the state's investor-owned utilities ran out of credit and cash, said they have financial ties with Enron.\n\n\"Their situation is not ringing alarm bells for us,\" said Gregg Fishman, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator (ISO), which manages the state power grid.\n\nThe ISO owes Enron money for purchases of daily power supplies but Fishman declined to say how much.\n\nAside from a 30-day supply contract earlier this year, Enron does not have any current power deals with the state's Department of Water Resources, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the agency which negotiates long-term agreements.\n\nOne top California energy regulator, however, said Enron's troubles offer an important lesson for energy markets.\n\nCarl Wood, a CPUC commissioner, said the deregulation of markets for basic services like electricity \"threatens as much financial volatility and instability as we have seen in the telecommunications and the dot-com industries.\"\n\nWood said, \"Enron is the flagship for deregulation, but there are definite dangers of venturing into unregulated market behavior. Enron itself apparently is becoming a victim of sorts. Our largest utility is in bankruptcy. One obvious conclusion is to keep the energy industry on a pretty short regulatory leash.\"\n\n\"The unregulated energy industry rises faster, but it also falls further,\" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer Rights, an advocacy group in Santa Monica, California .\n\n\"It's okay for a free market to operate for things like computers and other goods but energy is different. Regulatory structures are needed to protect customers,\" he said.\n\nEnron Portland Genl Sale Seen Going Smoothly This Time\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp's (ENE) current troubles won't jeopardize its $1.8 billion sale of utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), analysts and the companies said.\n\nIn contrast to Enron's previous attempt to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP), which foundered earlier this year on regulatory issues, the sale to the Portland, Ore.-based gas utility is expected to go smoothly.\n\nIt will need to, as Enron has said it is counting on sales of assets, including Portland General, to pay off $3.3 billion in notes coming due during the next 20 months.\n\n\"Enron has wanted out of this asset for a very long time,\" said Susan Abbott, an analyst with Moody's Investor Services. \"Right now, they need to sell some assets, and this would be a larger one that would give them some cash.\"\n\nThe energy giant's shares have lost about two-thirds of their value in the past three weeks and its credit ratings have been downgraded to within two steps of noninvestment grade levels due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.\n\nThose uncertainties were sparked Enron's $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to transactions with entities headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The notes coming due are also related to those entities. Enron's dealings with those entities are the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have raised investor hackles over a perceived lack of transparency.\n\nAnalysts said none of this will change plans for the Portland General sale - which will bring Enron $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in Northwest Natural Gas preferred stock, and $50 million in common stock.\n\n     Earlier Problems Not Seen Repeated\n\nIn April, a two-year old deal to sell the utility to Nevada company Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) for $2 billion collapsed due to changes in that state's laws that would have forbidden the utility's recovery of power costs if the sale went through. The deal had already been doomed for months due to Sierra Pacific's tenuous financial position.\n\nBut Northwest Natural's financial house is in order, and there is no apparent law or regulation that threatens to block the deal in Oregon or Washington, the two states where approval is needed, analysts said.\n\n\"Northwest Natural is very well-regarded by regulators in both states, and I think there's quite a bit of interest on the part of regulators to have the utility in local hands as opposed to somewhere down in Texas,\" said Gerald Keenan, utility analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nConcerns about the quality of Enron's credit may encourage state regulators to act more quickly on the sale, an analyst said.\n\n\"If I were a regulator, I'd be much more interested in having Portland General out from under Enron,\" the analyst said.\n\nThe Oregon Public Utilities Commission hopes to expedite its review of the sale so that it is complete in six months, rather than the usual 10, commission spokesman Bob Valdez said.\n\n\"Given the fact that we are familiar with the management and regulatory affairs of both companies and have dealt with them extensively, we hope it will take no longer than six months,\" said Valdez, adding that the commission expected to receive a filing on the sale Nov. 7.\n\nThe Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission hasn't received a filing, but once it does there is no statutory time limit on review, a spokeswoman said.\n\n     Federal Review Seen Uneventful\n\nIn addition to Oregon and Washington utilities regulators, the sale must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nNone has received filings yet on the sale, which is slated for completion in the fourth quarter of 2002.\n\n\"We are shooting for mid-November as far as submitting our request to the state commissions,\" Northwest Natural Gas spokesman Steve Sechrist said. \"Those will be the first major hurdle, then we'll move on to the federal filings.\"\n\nShareholders must also approve the acquisition. They will likely vote in spring of 2002, Sechrist said.\n\nNorthwest Natural, Enron and analysts said they don't expect hangups at the federal level.\n\nThe only thing that might create a problem for the sale, Keenan said, would be a \"significant deterioration\" of the natural gas or electricity markets harming the companies. Right now, however, things look good on that front.\n\n\"The market is much more stable than it was when Sierra Pacific tried to buy the utility. And the deal is much more practical this time: the price is lower and the terms are better,\" he said. \"Clearly it's important for Enron to be able to get this done, and I think they will.\"\n\nUSA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.\n\nNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said.\n\nBut there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer.\n\nAccording to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources.\n\n\"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace,\" said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study.\n\nSwezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories.\n\nThe study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products.\n\n\"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack,\" said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study.\n\nCALIFORNIA CAVEAT\n\nGreen power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California .\n\nBut in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims.\n\n\"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth,\" Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner.\n\nMore than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized.\n\nNon-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent.\n\nWith the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade.\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel.\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .\n\nIndia ONGC Plans Enron Oil,Gas Field Bid If BG Deal Fails\n\nSINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) said Friday that it would consider bidding for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) upstream Indian assets if U.K.-based BG Group PLC's (BRG) conditional acquisition of the assets collapses.\n\nBG paid $388 million for Enron's 30% stake in oil and gas fields offshore western India, but the sale is subject to a number of consents and conditions including confirmation from Enron and Gas India's joint venture partners - ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) - that BG will inherit field operator status from Enron.\n\nONGC and Reliance Industries are challenging BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field. BG have made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship.\n\n\"If BG wants to walk away, we'll come up with a plan. If they (Enron) offer (an opportunity to bid again), yes, then we will think about it,\" an ONGC spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires, without elaborating further.\n\nEarlier this year, ONGC bid a reported $400 million for Enron's Indian oil and gas assets, only to have its bid rejected. Analysts at the time said Enron was unlikely to settle for anything less than $600 million for its stake in the venture.\n\nONGC and Reliance Industries jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets.\n\nAs reported Thursday, BG said it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the fields for an unspecified period.\n\nHowever, analysts say BG's bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resistance from ONGC and Reliance.\n\n\"We want the operatorship,\" the ONGC spokesman reiterated.\n\nEnron's upstream oil and gas assets in India hold proven and probable reserves of around 170 million barrels of oil equivalent."}, {"mid": 3, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-06T07:28:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "PG&E Corp.'s profit jumps 243 percent / PG&E Corp. reports $771 million in profit / Lower power costs, rate increases boost earnings\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 6, 2001\n\nEnergy price probes widen to include state officials / Chief of power grid to be questioned\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 6, 2001\n\nPG&E Re-Evaluating New Construction of Pwr Plants - Execs\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 6, 2001\n\nSan Francisco to vote on public power\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 6, 2001\n\nPG&E Corp.'s profit jumps 243 percent / PG&E Corp. reports $771 million in profit / Lower power costs, rate increases boost earnings\n\nPG&E Corp. enjoyed a 243 percent jump in profit during the third quarter as its utility operations reaped an extra $687 million from a drop in power costs and record rate increases passed last spring.\n\nDespite millions in costs related to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and other losses, the utility's San Francisco parent company yesterday reported $771 million in net income for the three months that ended Sept. 30., up from $225 million during the year-ago period.\n\nHowever, the third-quarter profit could just be a blip. The utility could see profits fall if demand wanes during the winter months when usage declines, said PG&E Corp. spokesman Brian Hertzog. Profit could also decline in future quarters if the state of California boosts its demand for a share of ratepayer revenue, he said. The state has been buying power on behalf of utility customers since January, when PG&E buckled under soaring wholesale electricity rates.\n\nFor the past quarter the company reported net income from operations of $256 million, (70 cents per share), a slight gain from last year when it posted $248 million in net income from operations (68 cents).\n\nThe $687 million in profit flowing into PG&E Corp.'s coffers in just three months spurred consumer advocates to push for rate refunds.\n\n\"It just shows we're paying too much for energy now,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. Hoge said the company financial report, which shows a $4.3 billion cash balance, strengthens the group's claim that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing in April was unnecessary to pay off the utility's debts.\n\nHertzog said the third-quarter generation profit pales in comparison to the losses PG&E sustained last winter when power prices skyrocketed and the utility was prevented by a rate freeze from passing on the costs to consumers. The company wrote off $9 billion in unpaid costs, though it is suing to force the PUC to allow the utility to recover the money from ratepayers.\n\nTerrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the PUC, said PG&E Corp. may not get to keep the $687 million. \"The quarterly statement reflects money that PG&E Corp. is collecting that the PUC hasn't decided how to allocate.\"\n\nEnergy price probes widen to include state officials / Chief of power grid to be questioned\n\nIn June, as Californians braced for a summer of rolling blackouts, television cameras captured allegations from former Duke Energy employees that seemed to pin the state's energy mess on power providers.\n\nThe self-described whistleblowers told a legislative committee that Duke withheld power during the peak of California 's electricity shortage to boost prices, charges the company denied.\n\nBut more than four months later and at a cost that could top $10 million, state-sponsored investigations into the energy crisis have yielded no civil or criminal penalties against power providers. In fact, some probes started to scrutinize energy companies are now targeting other big players in the California energy market: state officials.\n\nInvestigators are looking into a range of accusations, from why the head of the state power grid helped open the flood gates to massive electricity price hikes to new complaints that the state department buying power is manipulating the market. Under subpoena, Terry Winter, who runs the California Independent System Operator, will be deposed today in the state Capitol.\n\nThe new questions have broadened the scope of the investigations into who the real culprit is in the state's electricity crisis.\n\n\"Who's the bad guy? The better question is who is wearing the white hat?\" said Gary Ackerman, spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing generators.\n\nWhen California blackouts became a punchline for late-night comedians, several state agencies began investigations:\n\n-- Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced he was investigating price-gouging by generators. He convened a grand jury in June to discover whether generators had purposely withheld power to the market to drive up prices.\n\n-- The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation was created by the Legislature. Run by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee hosted the Duke whistle-blowers and issued a flurry of subpoenas for records kept by energy providers.\n\n-- The Public Utilities Commission also began looking into the market and into allegations that generators had idled plants at key times.\n\nAll three investigations are continuing. The PUC has spent more than $800,000 on its review, Lockyer has $9 million to spend on his work and Dunn's committee is spending about $14,000 per month.\n\nLockyer has said he is looking into complaints that energy consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis had conflicts of interest. One consultant allegedly helped negotiate a long-term energy contract with an electricity provider he had recently worked for.\n\nThe state's Fair Political Practices Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are also exploring conflict-of- interest charges that led Davis to fire five consultants.\n\nDunn's committee is still looking into market manipulation by generators. But he has spent more time recently investigating the actions of state officials.\n\nDunn wants to know why the head of the ISO, Winter, asked federal regulators on Dec. 8 to drop caps on the price companies could charge for power. Winter made his pitch to the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee without telling Davis or his bosses, the 26-person ISO board that had regularly voted for strict price caps.\n\nThe committee quickly approved Winter's request, and energy prices began soaring. While ISO officials contend Winter had to kill price caps to keep generators interested in selling power to the state, Dunn is looking into whether Winter and the generators somehow colluded to drive up prices. ISO officials deny that Winter worked with generators to drop price caps.\n\n\"It seems ludicrous that Terry Winter wouldn't tell his bosses that he was about to take the boldest step in ISO history,\" Dunn said.\n\nDunn's committee also is probing recent complaints from generators that the state is manipulating the energy market.\n\nThe state Department of Water Resources, which began buying power in January after cash-strapped utilities no longer could, is demanding exclusive information about the power market from the ISO, generators allege. The department also has refused to pay generators for electricity it's buying unless it's told what generators' costs are.\n\nThat information could lead to one of the biggest buyers in the market -- the state -- with more data than other competitors, creating an unfair playing field, generators argue.\n\nWhile a DWR spokesman said the department is working with generators to address their concerns, the generators have asked federal regulators to step in. But Dunn said he'll investigate whatever group is wreaking havoc in the energy market.\n\n\"If those allegations are true, we now have a market participant exercising an undue influence on the market,\" he said. \"They're doing the same things the generators were accused of.\"\n\nPG&E Re-Evaluating New Construction of Pwr Plants - Execs\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- PG&E Corp (PCG) is re-evaluating how much new generation it will build in future years due to declining market demand and the impact of utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co's bankrutpcy, company executives said on an earnings call with analysts Monday.\n\n\"Previously we have said we will have 22,000 megawatts in 2004,\" said Tom Boren, President and CEO of PG&E Corp's National Energy Group unit. \"That's still being evaluated so we can't give new projections, but it's likely to be less than 22,000 MW.\"\n\nThe company will proceed with the construction of current projects worth 5,400 MW, and tolling arrangements worth 2,200, Boren added.\n\n\"We are not cancelling development projects at this time, and we are also moving forward with construction of the North Baja (natural gas) pipeline,\" Boren said.\n\nThe company's re-evaluation of how much generation it will build has more to do with the outlook of future market conditions than the condition of the company itself, Boren said. He declined to say if the company was reconsidering projects in a certain area of the country in particular.\n\nBoren made his statements during a conference call on the company's third-quarter earnings. As reported, the company's quarterly net income more than tripled, but earnings excluding items increased just 3.2% and missed Wall Street forecasts. Though the company expects to see an 8-10% growth in earnings per share from operations, several executives said that 2002 will be a \"challenging transition year\". Several controversial regulatory and legal steps needed to implement the utility's plan of reorganization under its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings will be put to the test in 2002, said PG&E Corp Chair, CEO and President Bob Glynn.\n\n\"It will be a transition year from our current organization to our post-plan-of-reorganization structure...There's not a member among us who thinks it will all be smooth sailing. The utility is already facing adverse regulatory decisions and the energy group is facing reduced forward prices for power ,\" Glynn said.\n\nThe utility filed a reorganization plan in September that would transfer all the utility's transmission and generating assets to unregulated subsidiaries, then spin off Pacific Gas and Electric as a publicly-traded retail distributor of electricity and natural gas.\n\nOne immediate challenge facing Pacific Gas and Electric is Tuesday's ballot measures in San Francisco to create a municipal power district. If the measures succeed, the utility would lose 8% of its customers.\n\n\"The utility is strongly opposed to the ballot initiatives. If they pass, there will be years and years of litigation,\" said Chris Warner, regulatory counsel for PG&E. \"The initiatives wouldn't affect the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction or schedule, however.\"\n\nThe utility is scheduled to explain its disclosure statement on the reorganization plan before a federal bankruptcy judge Dec. 19. If the judge approves the statement, it will be mailed to creditors for a vote. If it passes muster, another court hearing will be held to confirm the plan.\n\nCreditors seem to favor the plan, and, therefore, the company isn't seeking any alternative, such as a settlement reached between state regulators and California 's other financially troubled utility, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, a PG&E executive said. SoCal Edison's settlement of a federal lawsuit with the California Public Utilities Commission will allow it to bill its customers for $3.3 billion in debt and repay creditors using cash on hand.\n\nPG&E has filed a similar federal lawsuit against the commission claiming it has the right to raise retail rates to recover power costs. That lawsuit is on hold while the court determines how it interacts with a related decision made in bankruptcy court, said utility CEO and President Gordon Smith.\n\nAnother pending matter for the utility is a determination by the Department of Water Resources of how much revenue it will need from the utility through 2002 to pay for power purchases. The DWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's credit-strapped utilities since January. Pacific Gas and Electric has been paying an interim price of 10 cents a kilowatt hour since March for that DWR power.\n\n\"We're expecting a revised revenue requirement from the DWR as early as today,\" Warner said. \"The last announcement on Oct. 19 was that the overall requirement had shrunk by $2.5 billion, so we expect the requirement will go down accordingly for each utility.\"\n\nNo one at the DWR was immediately available to comment on the status of the revenue requirement.\n\nSan Francisco to vote on public power\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - After a year which saw California's energy system thrown into unprecedented turmoil, San Francisco votes on Tuesday on two proposals to establish a public power agency to take over the functions of struggling utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).\n\nThe two ballot initiatives, Measure F and Measure I, aim to make San Francisco the latest city in the country to set up a municipal utility district (MUD) - a potential blow to PG&E, which still serves some 4.7 million customers in northern and central California despite having declared bankruptcy in April at the height of the state's power crisis.\n\nBacked by businesses ranging from garbage companies to telecommunications firms that fear they could also be targeted by voters eager to take charge of their own city services, Pacific Gas & Electric has spent more than $1 million in an aggressive advertising campaign which describes the MUD idea as unrealistic and inefficient.\n\nBut supporters of the MUD proposals ranging from environmental activists to consumer groups say the time has come for San Francisco to fashion a utility district that is a nonprofit public entity rather than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm.\n\n\"The profit that is generated by the sale, transmission and management of electricity, is realized back into the rate structure,\" said Ross Mirkarimi, campaign manager for the group supporting the MUD proposals.\n\n\"Our utility ratepayers in San Francisco will see lower rates in a very quick period of time while we move from being an abused renter of a neglecting landlord like PG&E to owning our own infrastructure.\"\n\nThe battle over San Francisco's MUD proposals - which local pollsters say are running neck-and-neck - takes place after months of chaos as California's energy deregulation effort unexpectedly resulted in skyrocketing wholesale power prices, periodic blackouts, sharply higher consumer rates and financial crisis for the state's major utilities.\n\nRELIABLE, AFFORDABLE ENERGY\n\nPacific Gas & Electric, a division of PG&E Corp. , declared bankruptcy in April after running up billions of dollars in unpaid wholesale energy bills. The utility continues to function, however, and has repeatedly said it intends to use the bankruptcy process to put its finances in order.\n\nThe MUD proposal could threaten that plan. Under Proposition F, San Francisco would create a power agency run by a governing board, while Proposition I calls for San Francisco and the neighboring town of Brisbane to establish a municipal utility district with an elected board of directors.\n\nThat board would then consider whether or not San Francisco should take over PG&E's power transmission and distribution system in the city, as well as the city's small generating facilities owned by PG&E and Mirant Corp .\n\nSupporters say a MUD would deliver reliable, affordable energy, pointing to existing municipal utility districts in Sacramento, Los Angeles and other California cities as examples of how public power can shield consumers from the increasingly wild swings of deregulated energy markets.\n\nOpponents of the measure say it would thrust San Francisco into a role it is ill-equipped to play - developing a new city bureaucracy and then sending it out to compete with big league energy players in the the fast-paced and often cutthroat world of the power markets.\n\nUnlike established MUDs, San Francisco would not only have to buy the city's existing power infrastructure - at a cost of anywhere up to $1 billion - but might also find itself jockeying for power without the benefit of long-term contracts which have kept consumer rates low in places like Sacramento.\n\nDespite the jitters in the business community, the MUD proposal is backed by a number of major state and local political leaders as well as organized labor.\n\nPassage of one or both of the MUD proposals Tuesday does not guarantee that San Francisco would see a public power system established any time soon. PG&E has promised a court fight against any attempts by the city to seize its power infrastructure by eminent domain, meaning the measures could end up tangled in lengthy legal argument."}, {"mid": 4, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-08T08:06:03Z", "lang": null, "text": "Tally shows S.F. poised to operate its own water, power agency\nMercury News\nNovember 8, 2001\n\nPG&E to attack public power in court\nUtility prepares all-out offensive if final vote backs S.F. initiative\nSF Gate News\nNovember 8, 2001\n\nUS Power, Gas Companies Restrict Dealings With Enron\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 8, 2001\n\nStudy details problems with utility deregulation\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 7, 2001\n\nTally shows S.F. poised to operate its own water, power agency\n\nWith spring's blackouts and rate increases beginning to fade from memory, San Francisco was on the verge of becoming a public power city Wednesday amid promises of lower prices, stable supplies and an end to PG&E's monopoly.\n\nSan Francisco is set to join Los Angeles, Sacramento, Palo Alto and other California cities with publicly owned utilities and hopes to offer comparably low electricity rates once its new municipal water and power agency is in place.\n\nBut if anything is certain the day after the election, it is that nothing is certain about the future of public power in San Francisco. With 19,000 ballots uncounted, Measure F led by about 2,000 votes.\n\nThen there are enormous political and legal hurdles to creating a public utility. Among the most daunting:\n\n Coping with likely legal opposition from Pacific Gas & Electric, which has vowed to fight any takeover of its assets.\n\n Electing a board of directors from seven San Francisco districts and agreeing on how to proceed.\n\n Patching together a power supply from the city's Hetch Hetchy system, new solar energy sources and electricity purchases on the open market.\n\nThe complex electricity market, the uncertainty of San Francisco's budding solar initiatives and the potential legal delays mean the city's ratepayers will not see any changes soon, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California's Energy Institute.\n\n``There's a chance that, despite the vote, San Francisco won't wind up with a municipal utility,'' he said. ``I think this is a shot across the bow, but it's going to unfold over the course of years, not weeks or months. If people think suddenly we're going to see a huge change in the industry, I think they're misreading.''\n\nPG&E officials on Wednesday refused to speculate about the future of the bankrupt utility's operations in San Francisco. But the company pointed out that a second ballot initiative -- Measure I -- to create a municipal utility district for San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane had apparently failed, and that Measure F's lead was still razor-thin.\n\nWith the apparent failure of the municipal utility district, a very close vote on Proposition F, and a very low voter turnout, ``there is no strong sentiment in favor of municipalization in San Francisco,'' said an official statement.\n\nPublic power advocates painted a more optimistic picture, saying the obstacles to getting a city power agency running were not insurmountable, and that the failure of the more legally troubled Measure I means municipal power will flow sooner than if both measures had passed.\n\n``We lost a big battle, but we won the war for public power,'' said Ross Mirkarimi, director of the Yes on I and F campaign. ``San Francisco can begin its conversion to a water and power authority.''\n\nThe mechanics of establishing the new agency are sketched out in the ballot language.\n\nLater this month, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors will carve out seven electoral districts, and candidates for the board of directors will be required to declare for office in December.\n\nThe election is scheduled for the first week in March and, if necessary, a runoff will be held in April. The new board will be seated in May, and its first action is expected to be commissioning a study showing how best to bring public power to San Francisco.\n\nThere are a number of possibilities, said Ed Smeloff, assistant general manager for power policy at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The city's PUC, which operates the Hetch Hetchy Water and Power System, would be absorbed by the new power agency.\n\nOptions include building the city's own electricity delivery system; leasing PG&E's lines to deliver power to the city; or buying PG&E's power plants and distribution system outright, at a cost PG&E estimates at $800 million to $1 billion.\n\nThe city-run utility would be able to take advantage of tax breaks and low-interest loans to acquire the system, and repay the debt much like a mortgage. The agency would be authorized to purchase PG&E's assets through eminent domain.\n\n``You have to look at the data to decide if you can lower rates by buying out the PG&E system,'' Smeloff said. ``That's the purpose of the study. It's possible it could be less costly to use PG&E's lines and pay them for the delivery of power.''\n\nEven Measure F's most active supporters on Wednesday were beginning to talk about a municipal utility that stops short of a full takeover of the PG&E system.\n\n``In this economic climate you might be able to buy power more cheaply without taking over the infrastructure of PG&E,'' Mirkarimi said. ``With an energy glut coming on the market, they may be able to obtain power other ways. The point is, we have options.''\n\nPG&E to attack public power in court\nUtility prepares all-out offensive if final vote backs S.F. initiative\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Co., faced with the prospect of losing its right to sell power in its hometown after Tuesday's vote, is preparing an all- out legal battle to block seizure of the utility's power lines, senior executives said yesterday.\n\nOfficially, PG&E's message following Tuesday's vote is that support for public power is only marginal at best. \"There is no strong sentiment in favor of municipalization in San Francisco,\" the utility said in a brief statement.\n\nPrivately, PG&E executives said the utility would do anything it takes to stop public power from becoming a reality in San Francisco.\n\nA final ballot count will not be available until today at the earliest. But it appeared yesterday that Proposition F was headed toward victory. The measure would allow an elected board to declare eminent domain and purchase PG&E's San Francisco power lines.\n\nThe fate of a related public-power measure, Proposition I, remained uncertain.\n\nPG&E executives said utility officials from throughout the Bay Area had been summoned to the company's San Francisco headquarters yesterday for a high- level war council on the election outcome.\n\nAlthough a long-term strategy for fighting the public-power initiative remained elusive, the meeting's participants agreed that PG&E's attorneys must go on the attack, the executives said, requesting anonymity.\n\nThe company reportedly spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat the measures, and if either passes, the utility is ready to shell out millions more to tie things up in court.\n\n\"If you look at past history, we've always been aggressive about protecting our property,\" one executive said.\n\n\"Bring it on,\" countered Ross Mirkarimi, campaign manager for the public- power measures.\n\n\"The absolute arrogance of a bankrupt corporation threatening to dismiss the intent of voters will be met in court and successfully beaten back,\" he said.\n\nAny legal defense of propositions F and I would be made by the city attorney's office. A spokesperson for outgoing City Attorney Louise Renne declined to comment on the matter yesterday.\n\nBut a well-placed source in Renne's office scoffed at the suggestion that PG&E, even with its deep pockets, would be able to bully San Francisco in court.\n\n\"This is a 200-lawyer office, which is larger than most law firms in the city,\" the source said. \"If PG&E chooses to, they can try and paper us to death. But that will not affect the outcome.\"\n\nThe source said it appeared most likely that PG&E would attempt to challenge the public-power initiatives on constitutional grounds in federal court. Such a challenge could last at least two years, the source said.\n\n\"PG&E will not handle this with in-house lawyers,\" the source at the city attorney's office added. \"They'll hire an outside firm and pay up to $400 an hour for legal help. Meanwhile, the city will use salaried deputy city attorneys. This will be much cheaper for us.\"\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after running up more than $9 billion in debt under a rate freeze, stressed in its statement late yesterday that numerous hurdles still must be be overcome before a public utility could be created in San Francisco.\n\n\"It is important to recognize that there are still many other steps the city government and San Francisco voters must approve before any municipalization outcome could occur,\" the company said. \"An agency has to be formed, commissioners elected and a feasibility study conducted to determine if the city can run the system and justify a takeover.\"\n\nJohn Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, declined to comment further.\n\nPG&E has been fighting off public-power initiatives in San Francisco since the 1960s. One utility official said that unlike similar battles elsewhere, there was a \"pride factor\" involved for what is seen as the company's home turf.\n\n\"This is where our headquarters is, and our employees take a lot of pride in what they do,\" the official said.\n\nIn fact, no major California city has succeeded in establishing a public utility for nearly 50 years, since Sacramento took charge of its local power system.\n\nOnly about a quarter of all Californians receive electricity from a public entity. And if PG&E has its way, that number will not grow.\n\nThe utility amassed a war chest of $120,000 last year to crush a grassroots effort seeking a public utility in Davis. PG&E hired a small army of lobbyists and consultants, and ultimately prevailed by killing off the ballot measure.\n\n\"This kind of thing comes up every couple of years somewhere in our service area,\" a utility executive said. \"In all cases, we've fought fairly aggressively.\"\n\nUS Power, Gas Companies Restrict Dealings With Enron\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Trading companies in Enron Corp.'s (ENE) key North American power and gas markets are restricting their dealings with the ailing Houston-based giant, people at those companies said Wednesday.\n\nConcerns have mounted because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on its Internet-based system EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by about 75% and its credit ratings downgraded since mid-October due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.\n\n\"We've restricted our business with them,\" said Mike Smith, chief financial officer for Mirant Corp. (MIR) unit Mirant Americas Group, a Top 10 trader of power and gas in the U.S.\n\nSmith wouldn't be more specific, but his comments echoed those of others in the business.\n\n\"Our exposure to Enron is insignificant compared with the previous exposure,\" said Al Butkus, spokesman for Aquila Inc. (ILA), a Top 5 U.S. power and gas trader.\n\nTractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A., has limited the term of transactions with Enron to three years or less, a person at the company said. And a power broker said some medium sized western utilities have stopped trading with Enron even for near-term delivery.\n\nEnron didn't return calls seeking comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Enron was in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it was restating its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel.\n\n     Key Markets\n\nEnron's ability to transact in its core markets - North American wholesale gas and power - is essential if the company maintain the earnings and cash flow needed to emerge from its current credit crisis, Wall Street analysts and ratings agencies have said.\n   Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's credit\nto within two steps of junk-bond status last week and have it on watch for\nfurther downgrade.    Enron still has its supporters. Exelon Corp. (EXC) is\nmonitoring its own risk management, but hasn't changed its relationship with\nEnron, said Chief Financial Officer Ruth Ann M. Gillis.\n\"We haven't changed our relationship,\" Gillis said.\n\nEnron is a very important factor in the vitality of the wholesale energy markets, she said. They're still the \"largest, best\" of the companies out there, she said.\n\nLikewise, a trading floor manager at one energy company said Enron called earlier in the week and asked that the company increase its trading on EnronOnline. The company's EOL volumes had fallen, but it honored Enron's request out of respect for Enron's still market-making power.\n\nPPL Corp. (PPL) moved to mitigate its exposure to Enron following the downgrades, a person in the marketing organization at PPL EnergyPlus said.\n\n\"Enron would not be a first choice to do long-term transactions,\" the person said. \"For shorter terms, deals, they wouldn't be considered equally with everyone else. There's just too much risk there.\"\n\nSince Enron's troubles began several weeks ago, energy trading partners had stood by the company in ways that stock and bond traders hadn't. Until this week, \"business as usual\" was an almost constant refrain. Energy companies' immediate exposure to Enron was limited to a maximum of seven weeks of receivables, and Enron was paying its bills.\n\nBut for some of those companies, business as usual also meant not changing value-at-risk formulas, even though the formulas were generating ever lower allowable volumes of business with Enron as the company's credit quality deteriorated, one risk manager said Wednesday.\n\nLower value-at-risk limits got most trading companies to flatten their portfolios by taking positions to offset currently profitable long-term positions with Enron.\n\nPPL, for example, is still following its credit policy and as a result has limited its dealings with Enron, which has seen its credit quality fall, the person at PPL EnergyPlus said.\n\n\"We've taken a look at our book,\" the person said. \"Based on the events of this and last week, we've taken some action to mitigate the risk based on their ratings downgrade.\"\n\nTrading companies constantly evaluate their counterparties' credit and adjust their dealings accordingly, but rarely have been required to address problems on the scale of Enron's recent difficulties.\n\n\"It certainly ranks just behind California ,\" the person at PPL said.\n\n     Enron Claims Trading Normal\n\nAn Enron spokesman, reached later, said the company continues to see a normal range of transactions, including long-term deals.\n\n\"We've not seen closing out of positions,\" spokesman Eric Thode said.\n\nSusan Abbott, a managing director in corporate finance at Moody's, said the ratings agency wasn't aware of significant changes in trading companies' dealings with Enron. The agency continues to watch for new restrictions, in particular margin calls, which could quickly strain Enron's liquidity. A drop in new business with Enron isn't as much of a concern, she said.\n\n\"If you're restricting new business with the company, what you're doing is moving the company out of the market in an orderly way,\" Abbott said.\n\nPPL is shying away from doing deals with Enron and is limiting the dollar amount and terms of the deals it will do with the company, but hasn't yet imposed margin calls or required additional collateral, the person in the marketing organization said.\n\n\"Neither the credit thresholds nor our exposure threshold have been breached,\" the person said.\n\nPPL said it's limiting exposure to Enron for shorter-term deals too, the person said.\n\n\"Their liquidity just isn't there anymore,\" the person said.\n\nNo large company can afford to pull the plug on Enron, given the company's centrality to the power and gas markets.\n\n\"Enron is such a large player and they're so important in terms of maintaining the liquidity of the markets,\" said Sandy Fruhman, spokeswoman for Reliant Energy Inc. (REI). \"We see this as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry.\"\n\nEnron's North American wholesale trading unit brought in $1.9 billion in income before interest and taxes in the first nine months of the year, up from $1.1 billion in the same period last year.\n\nReliant continues to do business, but Fruhman wouldn't say specifically whether it had restricted its dealings.\n\n\"We're monitoring the situation carefully and making sure we follow prudent business practices,\" she said. \"But we're trying to work with them, because it's in the best interest of the entire industry to overcome their current problems.\"\n\nStudy details problems with utility deregulation\n\nWhether or not Oklahoma embraces power deregulation, electricity prices probably will rise. The question is how much.\n\nThat was one conclusion in a report presented to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission Tuesday. The commission ordered the study, conducted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory of Tennessee, to examine the state's deregulation issues.\n\nThe study raises the key question of whether price increases can be minimized with fair treatment for both consumers and power-generating companies. It also notes that the Oklahoma and regional power grids are inadequate to handle new power plants coming on line .\n\n\"It's sort of like walking a tightrope,\" said Stanton W. Hadley, an Oak Ridge researcher who presented the study before the commissioners. \"Once you do it wrong, it's hard to go back.\"\n\nThe commission took no action Tuesday. Commission Chairman Denise Bode called the meeting \"a brainstorming session.\" The commission wants to sidestep the nightmare of electricity deregulation in California . The Oklahoma Legislature postponed a decision this spring on deregulation.\n\nThe study, which is Phase II of Oak Ridge research on Oklahoma deregulation issues, lays out four possible scenarios for Oklahoma's electric future between now and 2010. The scenarios include continued utility regulation along with three types of free-market deregulation.\n\nUnder total deregulation, the study said, existing coal and hydroelectric plants would profit handsomely. Consumer prices would probably fall, at least for awhile. However, the numerous gas-fired \"merchant power plants\" being planned or built in Oklahoma probably would lose money. Some would fail.\n\nUnder a semi-deregulation scenario - in which power producers would be allowed to charge more to help pay for their plants - all power plants would make money, the study reports. But coal and hydroelectric plant profits would skyrocket even further, and average prices to customers could be 5 percent to 25 percent higher than under regulated rates.\n\nFor that reason, Hadley endorsed a fourth scenario in which coal and hydroelectric plants would continue under some form of regulation, allowing the different types of power plants to profit more equitably.\n\nUnder that scenario, prices of electricity generated at coal plants could be set through long-term contracts or continued regulation. They would sell at their cost plus a markup that was set by regulators.\n\nSuch an approach, he said, would likely lead to a \"win-win\" situation, with power plants thriving and consumers seeing only modest price increases.\n\nThe study also reported that power supply in Oklahoma will far outstrip demand during the 2001-2010 period. The state's power capacity of 13,300 megawatts will zoom to 25,700 by 2010, with at least 3,500 megawatts of reserve power.\n\nThe problem: That much power would overwhelm Oklahoma's power grid. Power lines were built to serve local customers, not to export huge quantities of electricity .\n\n\"Right now those lines can carry some of the proposed capacity, but not all,\" Hadley said.\n\nBode said the report's scenarios are based on today's power transmission capacity. The critical question, she said, is how much transmission capacity to build, and how to make it possible for new power plants to hook into that grid.\n\n\"You've got to build your infrastructure first,\" Bode said. \"We could have a real serious mess in 2010 if we don't get more transmission built.\"\n\nAbout 20 gas-fired power plants are either planned or are being built in gas-rich Oklahoma. Power merchants need to be able to ship electricity - a value-added product of the state's natural gas supply - out of state, Bode said.\n\nBy the same token, she said, the state needs to be able to retain enough reserve electric power to attract industry, fuel economic growth and keep power prices reasonable.\n\nDouglas Burton of Oklahoma City-based Acarus Group, representing major Oklahoma industrial power consumers, urged Bode and Commissioner Bob Anthony to consider a regional power grid concept, sharing the cost of transmission expansion with surrounding states.\n\nBurton called for \"no transmission welfare.\" She insisted that if Oklahoma tried to build a regional grid by itself, it wouldn't lead to a competitive market.\n\nHadley advised a go-slow approach to the wealth of issues and unknowns surrounding deregulation.\n\n\"Better to take more time,\" he said, \"and do it right.\""}, {"mid": 5, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-09T12:55:21Z", "lang": null, "text": "Canadian Pwr, Gas Mkts Benefiting From Enron's Woes\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 9, 2001\n\nFERC orders state to pay its power bills\nSan Diego Union Tribune\nNovember 9, 2001\n\nLegal group's suit seeks to overturn power deals\nSF Gate News\nNovember 9, 2001\n\nGAS PROCESSING FACILITIES PLANNED FOR CANADA, VENEZUELA\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 12, 2001\n\nCanadian Pwr, Gas Mkts Benefiting From Enron's Woes\n\nCALGARY -(Dow Jones)- Canadian natural gas and power exchanges are gaining strength as market unease over U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial woes increases and traders look to alternative vehicles, insiders said Thursday.\n\nBuyers and sellers are turning more to Alberta's power and natural gas exchanges as they shun the increasingly wobbly Enron.\n\n\"We see this as an opportunity to capture some of the market EnronOnLine had,\" WattEx president Sheldon Fulton told Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n\"It has also resulted in reinforcing the need for transparent pricing mechanisms and forward price curves,\" he said.\n\nEnron, a Houston-based market-mover accounting for a quarter of North American power and gas trades, has seen its credit ratings downgraded and its share price slashed since mid-October over uncertainty about its complex financial structure.\n\nIn response, energy companies in Canada have changed their strategies. Some, like PowerEx, British Columbia Hydro's marketing arm, reduced Enron's credit limit on day trades and dropped any long-term financial deals with the troubled company.\n\nOthers are keeping their strategies to themselves, commenting only that Enron's position as a major player makes it important for the entire industry to see a positive resolution to its woes, and maintain market liquidity.\n\n\"We continue to do business with Enron,\" said Jennifer Pierce, manager of public affairs for Duke Energy in Houston. \"We will continue to monitor activities as they go on and deal with credit guidelines that are established with them.\"\n\nAnd some are not dealing with Enron at all.\n\n\"We are not doing anything with (Enron),\" a trader with a major natural gas pipeline said. \"There are a lot of players out there.\"\n\nSpot deals on Alberta's Natural Gas Exchange hit 1.6 billion cubic feet Thursday, volumes that were up but not record-breakers, NGX vice-president Gary Gault said.\n\n\"It's tough for us to tell if the increase is due to Enron's problems,\" Gault said. \"But there is no question there are credit issues in the market right now over them.\"\n\nAlberta's NGX and Enron recently started joint submissions of near-month and daily traded volumes on a real-time basis to the NGX-owned Canadian Gas Price Reporter Index. The move created a more realistic view of the Alberta market, traders said, as Enron's near-month volumes were consistently higher than the Canadian exchange.\n\n\"This has obviously created a lot more interest in other trading vehicles,\" one source said. \"But this is just like when a big bank gets into trouble - the whole economy is affected.\"\n\nEnron is in talks with rival energy company Dynegy Inc. (DNY) for a cash infusion or possible merger. The embattled company also restated four and a half years of earnings Thursday.\n\nFERC orders state to pay its power bills\n\nSACRAMENTO -- Power generators called \"gougers\" and worse by state officials are getting help from federal regulators to collect about $1.2 billion they are owed by the state.\n\nAnd in another energy-related development, a conservative legal-action group, the United States Justice Foundation in Escondido, filed a lawsuit to overturn $45 billion worth of long-term power contracts obtained by the state.\n\nThe state has not been paying generators for last-minute power purchases made by the Independent System Operator since January to maintain adequate power levels in the California grid.\n\nThe ISO, which is controlled by appointees of Gov. Gray Davis, has been sending the bills for the purchases to the financially troubled utilities, even though the state began buying power for utility customers in January.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday ordered the ISO to bill the state power-purchasing agency, the Department of Water Resources, and to report the amount owed in 15 days and schedule payment within three months.\n\n\"We certainly intend to comply with that order,\" said Greg Fishman, an ISO spokesman.\n\nFishman said the ISO has not been sending the bills for last-minute power to the water department because of a previous federal requirement that was interpreted to mean that the bill should be sent to the user of the electricity, in this case the utilities.\n\nIn addition, he said, the water department has not been willing to pay bills unless it receives detailed information about the price and seller of power that had been withheld in the past to preserve a competitive market.\n\nIt was not clear yesterday whether the bills that the ISO will begin sending the water department will contain the specific information that department says it needs to make a payment.\n\n\"If the bill is adequate, we will pay it,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a water department spokesman. \"If we get a bill that is an aggregate bill, a lump sum, a generator could come to us a month from now and say, 'You never paid me.' \"\n\nAs it operates the grid, the ISO routinely makes last-minute purchases because the exact amount of power needed to maintain adequate levels in the grid cannot be predicted and purchased in advance.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric contended earlier this year that the state was trying to reduce its power costs by sending the bill for last-minute purchases to the utilities.\n\nHidalgo said the estimate that generators are owed about $1.2 billion for providing last-minute power is based on the unpaid bills that the utilities sent back to the ISO.\n\nThe federal commission said it was acting to \"prevent difficulties for the ISO in obtaining future energy\" and to ensure the prompt payment needed for a proper marketplace.\n\n\"What a comedy of errors,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, a generator group. \"That's a good way to make friends -- not pay them $1 billion.\"\n\nTwo generators, Mirant and Reliant, have filed a complaint with the FERC contending that the ISO gives preferential treatment to the water department that undermines generators required by the FERC to provide last-minute power to the ISO.\n\nAmong other things, the generators say the ISO gives the water department advance notice of a power shortage, which allows the department to provide the last-minute power from cheaper out-of-market sources.\n\nA hearing on the complaint by Mirant and Reliant has been scheduled for Tuesday by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market.\n\nEarlier this year, the state negotiated more than 50 long-term contracts to curb soaring wholesale power prices. But critics say the average price of power under the contracts is now about twice as high as power on the spot market.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by the United States Justice Foundation argues that the contracts are illegal because of violations of contracting policy and antitrust laws.\n\n\"This lawsuit seeks to invalidate these unfair and illegal contracts and put market forces back to work in the California electricity market,\" said Gary Kreep, executive director of the nonprofit foundation.\n\nLegal group's suit seeks to overturn power deals\n\nA conservative legal group filed a lawsuit yesterday that seeks to invalidate the estimated $43 billion worth of long-term electricity contracts signed by the state.\n\nThe United States Justice Foundation contends that the contracts violate the state constitution for several different reasons, including the fact that they were negotiated in secret by people who may have had conflicts of interest.\n\n\"Gov. Gray Davis illegally negotiated these contracts in secret,\" said Sen. Tom McClintock, R-Northridge. \"These contracts are the result not of simple misjudgment and incompetence. They are the result of misconduct.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed yesterday in Sacramento Superior Court, also alleges that by negotiating in secret, the Davis administration violated state's open meetings laws.\n\nDavis officials began signing long-term energy contracts last winter as a part of its attempt to reign in energy crisis. They argue that the contracts helped lower wholesale electricity prices in California.\n\nThe administration came under attack after it was revealed that some of the negotiators also owned stock in the companies they were negotiating with.\n\nGAS PROCESSING FACILITIES PLANNED FOR CANADA, VENEZUELA\n\nKvaerner has much to be thankful for, having just received US$36.5 million in contracts from Westcoast Energy for the engineering, design, fabrication, construction and commissioning of a gas processing facility. Last fall, Westcoast Energy's Pipeline and Field Services division announced plans to build a 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) natural gas pre-treatment facility near its existing Pine River gas plant, located in the northeastern part of the Province of British Columbia.\n\n\"This facility will process sour natural gas and facilitate the addition of 100 MMcf/d of gas to flow from the Pine River gas plant to markets in the lower mainland of British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest,\" according to our source. \"The plant will process and ship this gas on behalf of area producers as an addition to the existing Pine River plant and Grizzly Valley gathering system. It will feed into the existing Westcoast Energy mainline that runs from northeastern BC to Huntington at the Canada/U.S. border. Construction began in August, and operations are targeted to begin next summer,\" the source stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Duke Energy is continuing with its strategy to expand its natural gas infrastructure throughout North America, by acquiring Westcoast Energy in an $8.5 billion deal that is scheduled for completion early next year (see Midstream, Oct. 1). The Nov. 5 issue of GPR provided an in-depth view of Duke's efforts to strengthen its position in the North American gas market, why it feels this acquisition fits perfectly with its vision for the future.\n\nCanadian Pwr, Gas Mkts Benefiting From Enron's Woes\n\nCALGARY -(Dow Jones)- Canadian natural gas and power exchanges are gaining strength as market unease over U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial woes increases and traders look to alternative vehicles, insiders said Thursday.\n\nBuyers and sellers are turning more to Alberta's power and natural gas exchanges as they shun the increasingly wobbly Enron.\n\n\"We see this as an opportunity to capture some of the market EnronOnLine had,\" WattEx president Sheldon Fulton told Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n\"It has also resulted in reinforcing the need for transparent pricing mechanisms and forward price curves,\" he said.\n\nEnron, a Houston-based market-mover accounting for a quarter of North American power and gas trades, has seen its credit ratings downgraded and its share price slashed since mid-October over uncertainty about its complex financial structure.\n\nIn response, energy companies in Canada have changed their strategies. Some, like PowerEx, British Columbia Hydro's marketing arm, reduced Enron's credit limit on day trades and dropped any long-term financial deals with the troubled company.\n\nOthers are keeping their strategies to themselves, commenting only that Enron's position as a major player makes it important for the entire industry to see a positive resolution to its woes, and maintain market liquidity.\n\n\"We continue to do business with Enron,\" said Jennifer Pierce, manager of public affairs for Duke Energy in Houston. \"We will continue to monitor activities as they go on and deal with credit guidelines that are established with them.\"\n\nAnd some are not dealing with Enron at all.\n\n\"We are not doing anything with (Enron),\" a trader with a major natural gas pipeline said. \"There are a lot of players out there.\"\n\nSpot deals on Alberta's Natural Gas Exchange hit 1.6 billion cubic feet Thursday, volumes that were up but not record-breakers, NGX vice-president Gary Gault said.\n\n\"It's tough for us to tell if the increase is due to Enron's problems,\" Gault said. \"But there is no question there are credit issues in the market right now over them.\"\n\nAlberta's NGX and Enron recently started joint submissions of near-month and daily traded volumes on a real-time basis to the NGX-owned Canadian Gas Price Reporter Index. The move created a more realistic view of the Alberta market, traders said, as Enron's near-month volumes were consistently higher than the Canadian exchange.\n\n\"This has obviously created a lot more interest in other trading vehicles,\" one source said. \"But this is just like when a big bank gets into trouble - the whole economy is affected.\"\n\nEnron is in talks with rival energy company Dynegy Inc. (DNY) for a cash infusion or possible merger.

(ENE) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), according to energy markets lore these days.\n\nAfter all, the logic goes, there will be two of everyone.\n\nEnron traders aren't so sure of that, as energy firms can attest.\n\n\"In the past 60 days, the number of resumes from Enron personnel has increased substantially,\" said William Begley, head of the energy and utilities practice at Heidrick & Struggles (HSII), an executive recruiting firm in Houston.\n\nResumes are coming from all units at Enron, but the number of those from traders has grown significantly during the period, he added. Other recruiting firms said that Enron traders have become more receptive to unsolicitied headhunting calls lately.\n\nNo one knows for sure how jobs will shake out at Enron, as the company goes through hard times and faces a merger with Dynegy. Recruiters and Enron employees are mixed over how much actual fallout there will be.\n\nOne thing they agree on, though, is that if Enron traders do leave, they aren't guaranteed to find new jobs quickly despite their credentials -- which are regarded as sterling in the energy industry. If energy markets contract as a result of Enron's troubles, the job market for traders could flood.\n\nDynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap currently valued at $10.12 billion. The companies confirmed the deal late last week. Shares in both companies rose in heavy trading Monday as investors weighed the planned deal. Some uncertainty remains around the fate of the merger, partly because of the numerous regulatory hurdles it faces.\n\nEnron, still the largest energy trading company in the world, has suffered a massive setback in the past month. Four weeks ago, a $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder equity kicked off a slide in the company's share price, and prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.\n\nRecruiters started seeing more resumes from Enron before the company's troubles came to a head. As early as this summer when former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling left the company, employees at the company's non-core units have been looking for jobs, recruiters said.\n\nElectricity and natural gas traders at Enron have long been considered some of the smartest participants in U.S. energy markets. The company is a market maker in both gas and electricity, meaning that its prices for both commodities are benchmarks for traders throughout the markets.\n\nEnron led the effort to deregulate U.S. power markets, and has been one of the most vocal lobbyists for deregulation at the state and federal levels over the years.\n\n\"Because Enron is such a large counterparty in the energy trading sector, all of its trading partners, everyone, is hoping the thing gets resolved,\" said Bruce Peterson, managing director at Korn/Ferry Intl (KFY) in Houston, an executive search company. \"The whole industry is definitely affected by what has happened at Enron. Until it's sorted out, you have a tremendous amount of uneasiness. It needs to get resolved.\"\n\nIt will be essential for Dynegy to keep some of the core leadership from Enron, analysts say. By retaining the best, Dynegy should be able to secure other strong Enron employees.\n\n\"In our view, Enron's energy trading and marketing personnel are arguably the most talented and definitely the most profitable group in the industry,\" Prudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale said in a research note Monday. \"We believe that Dynegy must focus on retaining these valuable traders and marketers if the new company is to realize its full potential in the wholesale segment.\"\n\nEnron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley, who will be at Dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president, said in a conference call on Monday that he believes the new company will retain its traders. \"Most traders want to be part of the winning team,\" he said.\n\nSome recruiters believe that although many Enron employees are floating resumes, there won't be much actual fallout. Enron's trading operation employs between 1,000 and 1,500 people in North America; Dynegy's operation is staffed by 300.\n\n\"But with a few trimmings here and there you won't see a lot of Enron traders on the street, unless they don't like what they hear from Dynegy,\" said Jack Carr managing director of Prime Energy Partnership, a search and recruiting company based in the UK, with an office in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAn experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn $125,000-$150,000 plus a bonus, according to Carr.\n\nRight now, Enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused, according to one trader at another company who wouldn't allow his name to be used.\n\n\"I think they're very nervous,\" the trader said. \"The Enron people think they're better than the Dynegy people, and the Dynegy people think 'we're buying them, so we can just pick through their stuff.'\"\n\nMedia to get access to state power pacts\n\nA coalition of news organizations settled with the governor's office on the only remaining issue in a lawsuit seeking access to the state's contracts with power generators.\n\nThe settlement will require the state to release short-term and spot-market energy contracts within 47 days of the end of each contract period.\n\n\"It's not as soon as we wanted, but it's not the lengthy delay the governor wanted. It's somewhere in between,\" said Alonzo Wickers, the attorney for the news organizations.\n\nSpot-market contracts are agreements for 90 days or less, and short-term contracts last 91 days to a year.\n\nThe legal battle began in February, when a handful of news organizations, including The San Diego Union-Tribune, sued Gov. Gray Davis to get information about the contracts under the California Public Records Act. Davis' spokesman could not be reached for comment yesterday.\n\nIn June, a Superior Court judge ordered the state to release its long-term contracts, which revealed that the contracts the governor negotiated had bound the state to huge electricity costs through the end of the decade.\n\n\"All the self-congratulatory proclamations from the governor's office about how beneficial these contracts were for the state of California didn't pan out,\" Wickers said. \"It certainly seems the public had a right to know.\"\n\nState energy spending plunges\nWater official trumpets decline as cost control\n\nSacramento -- The state's spending on energy plummeted in October to its lowest level this year, according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Water Resources.\n\nCalifornia spent $415 million on power purchases in October, half of what it spent in August and $264 million less than in September.\n\nSince January, the state has been purchasing power for the three investor- owned utilities. At the market's peak, the cost of power was an average of $65 million a day.\n\nOctober's average was $13.4 million a day.\n\n\"These steep declines in our overall power expenses are an obvious signal that California has accomplished the task of controlling what were once runaway costs in the spot market,\" said Pete Garris, acting deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, which is in charge of buying the state's power.\n\n\"Each month since May, California has been able to slash hundreds of millions of dollars off its costs,\" Garris said. \"These overall costs are a good measure of how successful we've been in lowering the price of energy.\"\n\nHowever, the department said it did not have figures for how much power the state sold last month. Without those numbers, consumer advocates say, it is impossible to know how well the state is doing.\n\n\"We need to know the entire picture,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. \"If we bought too much and are selling it at a loss, we need to know that.\"\n\nHoge said this is especially important as the state begins to try to renegotiate long-term power contracts.\n\nGov. Gray Davis and his administration began negotiating and signing long- term contracts during the height of the energy crisis. Davis and others say the contracts helped drive down the price of power, but critics say the state locked in too much power at too high a price.\n\nFor the three months ending in June, the state sold about $25 million worth of power, at times even giving electricity away.\n\n\"We may need to take a broader look at the contracts,\" Hoge said. \"The downturn in natural gas prices has made a huge difference.\" That's because much of the electricity on the market is produced by plants that run on natural gas.\n\nAlthough the Davis administration has said it is open to renegotiating the contracts, it has made no progress thus far.\n\nA spokesman for the department said numbers detailing how much power the state has sold will be available later this month."}, {"mid": 7, "parent": null, "author": "Binns, Darran DBINNS", "time": "2001-11-16T09:35:32Z", "lang": null, "text": "Governor's greased lighting\nDavis criticized for accepting money from power companies\nSF Gate News\nNovember 16, 2001\n\nIndia Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 16, 2001\n\nOntario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation\nDow Jones Interactive\nNovember 16, 2001\n\nGovernor's greased lighting\nDavis criticized for accepting money from power companies\n\nSacramento -- After having sworn off campaign contributions from energy companies, Gov. Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state.\n\nThe two $25,000 contributions came during a series of fund-raisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n\nThe Democratic governor, who has raised more than $30 million for his re- election campaign, has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration.\n\nYesterday, Davis defended the decision to take the money, saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us.\n\n\"My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in 2001,\" he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies. \"To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process. \"\n\nBut consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned.\n\n\"If it was dirty money before, it is even dirtier now,\" said Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over, Rosenfield said.\n\n\"Tell that to the 20 million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of 50 percent,\" he said.\n\nThe two companies -- FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC -- each gave $25,000 to Davis' campaign fund.\n\nBoth contributors have proposed projects pending in California.\n\nCaithness Energy, a New York-based generator, is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month. The company wants to build a 560-megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County.\n\nAnd subsidiaries of FPL Energy, a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country, are in negotiations with the state's new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California. The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them.\n\nIn addition, Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County. That project was approved by the state's Energy Commission in March.\n\nGarry South, Davis' political adviser, said the campaign's position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests.\n\nSouth said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant.\n\n\"It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state,\" he said. South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made.\n\nIndia Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week\n\nNEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday.\n\nThe possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX)\n\n\"After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,\" Doda said.\n\nU.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost.\n\nDabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC.\n\n\"The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,\" Doda said.\n\nDoda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol.\n\n\"So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,\" he said.\n\nOntario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation\n\nThe planned deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market.\n\nThe plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe.\n\nDavid Lindsay, the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser, confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration.\n\n\"We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this one,\" he said yesterday.\n\nHe would not provide details, though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year.\n\nA senior official in the Ontario government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal \"is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro.\" He was referring to the debt-laden utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans 30,000 kilometres.\n\nThe Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that \"there are a number of options on the table.\"\n\nSources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion through the sale of bonds to investors.\n\nThe dealers' commission on the sale of the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said.\n\nMr. Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the $21-billion in \"stranded debt\" racked up by the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province's balance sheet.\n\nHydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders.\n\nExecutives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring.\n\nThe government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange.\n\nThe third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option, though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise.\n\nSources said that Hydro One management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage.\n\nIt would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options.\n\nRod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president, would not comment on the not-for-profit option being contemplated by the government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market. \"Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\nStanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro One's strategic business plan).\n\nIn a three-page letter sent this week to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said that \"this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario.\"\n\nHe argued that \"the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers.\" He also said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in \"new bottleneck-eliminating connections\" that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter. \"Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,\" he said.\n\nIn a recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote, \"With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States, where ownership tends to be fragmented.\"\n\nHe noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has \"the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive high-growth initiatives.\"\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers.\n\nRestructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company.\n\n\"The problem with a Canadian National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,\" said one financier familiar with the proposal. \"With a debt-based structure, every dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments.\"\n\nDofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year.\n\n\"We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,\" Mr. Forstner said. \"Until that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontario's boundaries.\" Hydro One at a glance\n\nOntario's electricity transmission system split off from the former Ontario Hydro in May, 2000.

The company and other corporate interests spent more than $2 million to defeat the effort.\n\nColen's vote reflected the sentiment throughout the city's conservative strongholds -- among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods -- and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff. In those neighborhoods, Proposition F and Measure I lost almost 2 to 1.\n\nIn the city's more liberal neighborhoods -- Haight-Ashbury, Bernal Heights, South of Market and Noe Valley -- the reverse was true. And in the Mission, support for public power was almost 3 to 1.\n\n\"Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources,\" said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, a public power booster. \"Once we engaged people, talked to them, they were very responsive. I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again.\"\n\nFor Colen, an environmental geologist and consultant, the proposals were poorly drafted, more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PG&E than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably -- as backers of the measures promised.\n\n\"San Francisco can get into the energy business,\" said Colen. \"But it should be incremental, with a sound policy, and with people in charge who are experts.\"\n\nIn addition, he doesn't want an elected board running the operation, as both Measure I and Proposition F required, and he wants the city to explore working with PG&E instead of ousting the private utility competely. Then, Colen said, he may support public power.\n\nProposition F called for replacing the city's existing water and power department with a new, expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers. It lost by 533 votes, or less than 1 percentage point.\n\nMeasure I, the more far-reaching of the two, lost by 4,361 votes, or 3.5 percentage points. It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane. It made a target of PG&E but also had the power to take over the garbage, cable and phone operations.\n\nDespite the loss, supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea. Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval. At the same time, they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year.\n\nBob Lipman, a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow, voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago. His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system. \"It was a blank check,\" he said. He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down.\n\nSupervisor Tony Hall, the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures, agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy.\n\n\"People want to know how much this is going to cost,\" Hall said.\n\nAmmiano, the author of Proposition F, said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs, generation capabilities, financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios.\n\n\"While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency, I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue, explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests, business owners and property owners backing the idea,\" Ammiano said.\n\nAnother factor, he said, is voter turnout.\n\n\"If we had 1 percent higher turnout we probably would have won,\" Ammiano said.\n\nFor example, several neighborhoods -- among them the Western Addition, Civic Center and the South of Market -- had turnout lower than the citywide average, which was just less than 30 percent.\n\nSupervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters -- not putting efforts into wooing conservatives.\n\n\"I truly believe I don't have to change people's minds,\" said Daly, who favors local control of the electrical system. \"I represent the majority opinion. But the majority doesn't necessarily come out to vote. That's what we have to work on.\"\n\nPG&E CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE  - TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY, BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS\n\nMARTINEZ -- PG&E crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez, which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil.\n\nCrews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas & Electric in bankruptcy court.\n\nThe substation cleanup should be completed by mid-December at a cost of $225,000, said PG&E spokesman Jason Alderman. Cleaning up Tom Billecci's and Vince Aiello's properties will cost about $64,000.\n\nOnce the substation site is free of contaminants, the utility will sell the property to a developer, who plans to build apartments.\n\nThe cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property, Alderman said.\n\n\"The reason it's expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done,\" he said.\n\nThe utility operated a substation at the site from 1910 to 1990. The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PG&E about the cleanup for a year. They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer, asthma and skin disorders.\n\nThe utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic. Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup.\n\nPG&E will clean the area around a shed on Billecci's property, something it had not planned to do before.\n\nBillecci said he is pleased that PG&E agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup\n\nReliant to slash rates 17 % when deregulation begins\n\nResidential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about 17 percent.\n\nThat's according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission.\n\nUnder the new so-called price-to-beat rate - which still needs PUC approval - someone using an average of 1,200 kilowatt-hours a month could save $257 over the course of a year, while someone using an average of 2,000 kilowatt-hours a month could save $426 annually.\n\nThe big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices. Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of 2000 and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed. This year's increase, though, was rescinded as gas prices came down.\n\nThe rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan. 1 - when Texas opens its electricity market to competition - is known as the \"price to beat.\" Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers.\n\nThe price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors, which in turn are expected to offer lower rates.\n\nOther incumbent electric companies, including Dallas-based TXU Energy, will charge their own price-to-beat rates in their service territories.\n\nThe PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation, but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market.\n\nConsumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors' profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices.\n\nTo set the price to beat, the PUC uses complex formulas: Costs are sorted into several categories, including a \"base rate,\" as well as costs tied to the price of natural gas, which affects the price of electricity.\n\nUnder the deregulation law, consumers automatically get a 6 percent cut in the base portion starting Jan. 1, which, depending on usage, can make up 60 percent of a consumer's costs.\n\nThe PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the so-called fuel-factor portion of the price to beat.\n\nThe figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company. The three-member commission still must give its approval, which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec. 3 meeting.\n\nThe current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses 14,400 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a year - or an average of 1,200 a month - is 10.42 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nUnder the numbers Reliant filed Friday, the cost would be 8.64 cents per kilowatt-hour. That's a drop of 17 percent.\n\nThose per kilowatt-hour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher. Reliant charges different rates for summer and non- summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins.\n\nThe per kilowatt-hour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized, average rates. All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an apples-to-apples way to compare them.\n\nReliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the base-rate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose 40 percent of their customers. The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs.\n\nEarlier this week, consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC, if adopted, could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers.\n\nThat option, which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed, isn't included in Reliant's filing. A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea, and it's unknown whether the PUC will ever take an up-or-down vote.\n\nCompetitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be.\n\nIn a filing Thursday with the PUC, the New Power Co., which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere, said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas.\n\nBecause there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation, a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program, New Power said.\n\n\"New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition, but, like everyone else, we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds,\" it said."}], "summary": "The first email thread discusses the need for a streamlined process for building power plants in New York.

I'd like to begin by apologi=\nzing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the=\n last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=\nple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through=\n who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20\n\nIn this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=\no do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=\n, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=\n, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addi=\ntion to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have ac=\ncepted positions with UBS Warburg:\n\nLast Name=09First Name=09Last Name=09First Name=09\nAmador=09Susan=09Oh=09John=09\nAnderson=09John=09Platter=09M=09\nBulbes=09Victor=09Postlethwaite=09John=09\nChang=09Fang-Tzu=09Richter=09Jeffrey=09\nChatterton=09Jill=09Robinson=09Donald=09\nCrandall=09Sean=09Salisbury=09Holden=09\nCutsforth=09Diane=09Scholtes=09Diana=09\nDasovich=09Jeff=09Semperger=09Cara=09\nDavidson=09Debra=09Sheidun=09Donna=09\nDean=09Craig=09Shields=09Jeffrey=09\nDunton=09Heather=09Slinger=09Ryan=09\nEtringer=09Michael=09Solberg=09Geir=09\nGilbert=09Michael \"Scotty\"=09Steiner=09David=09\nGustafson=09Mollie=09Stokley=09Marlin \"Chris\"=09\nHall=09Stephen=09Swain=09Stephen=09\nHeizenrader=09Timothy=09Swerzbin=09Michael=09\nKandaswamy=09Balachandar=09Thomas=09Jacob=09\nLackey=09Christopher=09Thome=09Stephen=09\nLee=09Eugene=09Van Houten=09Maria=09\nMallory=09Patrick \"Chris\"=09Villeggiante=09Theresa=09\nMcDonald=09Michael=09Wente=09Laura=09\nMeyer=09James=09Williams=09William J=09\nMeyers=09Albert=09Woodland=09Andrea=09\nMier=09Michael=09Yoder=09Christian=09\nNelson=09Kourtney=09=09=09\n\nWhile there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =\nof the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=\nt entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=\noks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=\nry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=\n  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=\n well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=\nt together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =\nongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=\nmmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=\n  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=\nhter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=\n get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=\nlking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =\nseveral of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =\nam hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=\n the power procurement and delivery efforts.\n\nAs most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =\nhas already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=\nted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=\ne to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=\n the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.\n\nThe UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=\ndle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=\n or about February 6th.\n\nFinally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=\n over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=\non story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=\ninding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =\nbeen easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=\nwesome team that we have put together.

How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNolte, Ron\nSent:\tSaturday, November 03, 2001 6:09 PM\nTo:\tHorn, Cindy; Whiting, Elaine; Timson, Sarah; Das, Sarita; Hunter, Larry Joe; Bonanno, Joann; Sorenson, Jefferson D.; Leggett, Tim; Callaghan, Shawna\nSubject:\tIssue to be resolved and acted upon\n\nWorkflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.\n\nWhen a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.\n\nDCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.\n\nIssue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.\n\nI have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.\n\nFirst of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?\n\nSecond,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate\nthat the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.\n\n**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is \"Any\".  But \"Any\" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that \"Any\" means \"Any Global Product\" ;\"Any\" means \"anything\".\n\nOK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.

The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.\n\nIssue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.\n\nI have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.\n\nFirst of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?\n\nSecond,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate\nthat the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.\n\n**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is \"Any\".  But \"Any\" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that \"Any\" means \"Any Global Product\" ;\"Any\" means \"anything\".\n\nOK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.\n\nEven if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.\n\nPlease note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.

A pig needs to be ran from the Canadian River Station to P-3 on the TW 24\" Panhandle Lateral. In order to be able to do this, we will need to receive gas at Canadian River Station preferably by Williams. I understand that we only have gas flow going from P-3 to Canandian, but in order for us to maintain pipeline integrity, we need to work together to make this happen twice a year. We work with Williams to enable them to run a pig, so I'm sure they would be willing to work with us. Currently this is our only alternative since we are unable to pig from P-3 to Canadian. It has been several years since this pig has been ran and the last time P-3 was flooded with fluid.\n\nAs far as the Leedey Lateral goes, we need to pig, but economics will be hard.

Enron Corp. will be pretty easy, a=\nlthough Northern was for a brief period of time in the early 90s a division=\n of Enron Corp., and Northern had non-contiguous gathering in South Texas t=\nhat stopped right at the Zapata County line.  If that gathering system took=\n gas from, say, a well in an adjacent county that was communitized with a l=\nease in Zapata County, Enron Corp. may stay in the picture.  Last, with res=\npect to Intratex, I am told by Lou that we no longer have the Intratex docu=\nments; did they go with HPL as a result of the sale?=20\n\n=09Becky and I are stretched thin on various matters right now and would li=\nke to suggest that we retain Marianne Salinas on this project immediately. =\n=20\n\n=092. I think it would be helpful to snag a first-rate gas measurement cons=\nultant now, before they all get taken.  I know Ken Cessac, who works here, =\nvery well, and think a great deal of him.  I know Andy has used him extensi=\nvely already in Grynberg-related matters.  You may want to save money and n=\not retain our own consultant, and instead rely on Ken; however, I know that=\n Ken is being kept very busy.  On the other hand, I also think it is likely=\n that we will wind up sharing at least the testifying gas measurement exper=\nts and their costs.  So, this is a judgment call.  However, I would be incl=\nined to go ahead and retain Paul LaNasa, who sits on several AGA committees=\n, as an Enron-only consulting expert, even though I don't think he is up to=\n speed on the Grynberg allegations.  Both Grant Harvy and I were very impre=\nssed by him during the Northern v. ONEOK arbitration, during which we worke=\nd with him extensively and presented him as an expert witness (although I d=\non't proposed to use him as a testifying expert here).  My point would be t=\nhat if there was anything wrong with Enron's measurement that was either wo=\nrse than or better than our co-defendants' measurement,  or put us in a dif=\nferent position, I am very confident he could point it out to us. =20\n\n=09I appreciate your thoughts.\n\n=09Britt"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Davis, Britt BDAVIS", "time": "2001-10-25T15:05:22Z", "lang": null, "text": "Marianne,\n\n\tASAP, can you find out whether any of the Enron entities named in this suit have ever paid any taxes assessed by the County of Zapata or the Zapata County Independent School District?

As I understand it, there are two types of county ad valorem taxes that might be relevant in this lawsuit:  a tax on reserves in the ground pre-production, which is typically paid by the producer, and a tax on gas that has been produced and then stored in some sort of storage facility in that county (although I didn't ask, I again assume that the owner of the gas in the storage facility or the owner of the gas storage facility pays that tax).\n\n\tIf I recall correctly, you advised me that none of the three Enron defendants named (Enron Corp., Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. and Intratex) had paid either of these two types of ad valorem taxes back as far as your records show.  I am hoping that you can say that based on your records, none of these entities owned any reserves in Zapata County or stored in gas in Zapata County or owned any storage facilities in Zapata County (whatever the relevant question is) for as far back as your records go (I recall you mentioning that none of these entities stored gas in Zapata County, but I can't remember if I asked you if I also asked you to confirm that none of these entities owned any gas reserves in Zapata and I don't know how far back your records go).\n\n\t(Of course, if I have gotten any of this wrong or mischaracterized what you've said, please let me know).\n\n\tIf I haven't worn out my welcome, would you be the right person to be able to sign an affidavit supporting the foregoing?

All the defendants were represented by either in-house or outside counsel.  Parenthetically, plaintiffs have still not served Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.  The only Enron defendants who have been served are Intratex and Enron Corp.  Parenthetically, again, all served defendants have been given an extension of time until December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.\n\n\tThe items discussed were as follows:\n\n\t1.  Comment on the wording and time frame for filing three draft form pleadings prepared by F&J:\n\n\ta.  a motion to the plaintiff's counsel to show authority;\n\n\tb.  a plea to the jurisdiction; and\n\n\tc. an answer and affirmative answer.\n\n\t2.  Whether the holding companies should file motions to transfer venue.\n\n\t3.  Whether there should be a joint defense fund, with a formal joint defense agreement.\n\n\tAt the end of the discussion, it was concluded as follows:\n\n\t1.  The F&J draft pleadings looked good, and all agreed to recommend to their respective client group that (a) each group of defendants would file their own plea, answer and affirmative defenses on December 5, the deadline for doing so (I will circulate a draft tailored for the Enron defendants well before then) but that (b) all the served defendants would join in the motion to show authority. Although, strictly speaking, this is not a classic case for a motion to show authority, no one saw a downside to it, and thought the presence of such a motion would be additional help in putting off any discovery requests.  The big concern in this case is keeping Grynberg from getting discovery here that could help him in his other cases.\n\n\t2.  I was tasked with the job of legal research on whether the non-measurer, non-taxpayer holding companies had a good shot at a motion to transfer venue, and whether there was any downside to so moving.  Of course, under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, such a motion must be filed before any other plea or pleading but for a special appearance, or it is waived.\n\n\t3.  No one appeared interested in a joint defense fund or a formal joint defense agreement, and it was agreed that the parties would pass around projects for the common good (like item #2) on a \"rough justice\" basis.\n\n\tI will continue to keep you advised.\n\n\tBritt"}], "summary": "The joint defense group discussed the wording and time frame for filing three draft form pleadings.

I imagine\nit will take them at least a couple of weeks  per Louise's request, the\nauditors are re-reviewing the management report to ensure that all the\nchanges were made and the report is now accurate\nI think you are aware of all the new products Dale is working on (!!!) we\nhave several things in the works right now, the primary ones being a park and\nloan agreement that will be managed out of Chicago, and reliable power\nLots and lots of ad hoc reporting (see my earlier e-mail regarding timing of\nthese reports - we need a decision quickly - this is taking up most of Matt's\ntime, and with the additional reports requested, it will take up the rest of\nit)  I have been sending you the weekly reports we are doing to John and\nJeff.  Louise asked that we provide similar reports for Europe.  We are\nstarting this week on these\nWe really need to push the profiles manager application - we are getting\nswamped with all the new customers and products (Frank was to talk to Mark D.\non Friday - I should have an update from him today)  this new application\nwill save a ton of manual work - this is something we started as soon as I\ntook over the group, and also was one of the auditors comments.  Currently,\nwe are manually entering profiles directly into EOL.  This application we\nrequested will allow each of the depts (Credit, Global and Legal) to enter\ntheir own profiles into EOL, and we will just become the reviewer of the data\nvia daily reporting.  The application has been tested, but due to the fact\nthat the IT group is so busy, we have been placed on the back-burner.  I am\ngoing to turn up the heat on this b/c we are getting overloaded.\nNew reporting application - we are in the process of testing now.   It will\nprobably be at least a month before it is completed.  This is our new Oracle\napplication that will replace the Access report Euginio built\nTorrey will be attending the 8am meeting for me in the morning and will send\nme notes  this is the weekly marketing/phase 2 meeting\nI am currently reviewing the latest version of the price posting agreement to\ndetermine what our roles will be once we are posting prices on the other\nplatforms (looks like most of it will fall in Dale's world)  You probably saw\nthe announcement that we are going to post prices on other websites\n(HoustonStreet and True Quote) that was made on Thursday last week.\nBasically, we have 90 days to make this happen.  IT will build the link to\nthese other sites, and we will need to ensure that price are reflected\nproperly and that product long and short descriptions are accurate.  I have\nread about 25% of the agreement thus far and am developing a list of\nquestions and concerns surrounding this.\nWe still are not including the proper weather valuation in the management\nreport - the numbers are not going to be significant, but we need to report\nthis appropriately asap.  Any decision here?  We have been working with the\nweather risk groups to determine how to appropriately value the weather\ntransactions.  About a month ago, we reached an agreement with them and have\nbeen waiting on Dave's approval to change the valuation ever since.\nKeith has made some suggestions on how we can improve the Remedy application\n- I am reviewing while I am here  This is the application that the call\ncenter uses to track issues\nI will send you the suggestions Stephanie has for improving the new security\napplication - she will document these for me today  A new SRRS system is in\nplace via the Intranet.\n\nstuff for you -\nCarrie S. will begin her 6 month assignment now.  She will be in Australia\nfor 3 weeks to assist Justin (the PCG person in the Pacific), then to London\nfor a month to work with Amita, and the duration will be spent working with\nthe London EOL Marketing team\nJustin just completed 3 weeks of training on EOL and EOL applications.  I\nthink he will do an excellent job - I was very impressed with his questions\nand how quickly he picked things up.\n\nJust send me any questions you have -\n\nThanks\nSheri"}, {"mid": 3, "parent": null, "author": "Susan Scott", "time": "2000-10-23T09:56:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "You won't believe this...Craig became obsessed with the idea of staying at\nthe Mondrian, so he booked one night there and one at Oceana.

The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need\ninserted.THANKS\n\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 11:32 AM\nTo: Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Enerfin meter 980439 for 10/00\n\nSherlyn, I've placed the correct volumes for days 6 and 9 for ENA.  I'll have\nthe deal extended for Dynegy and let you know when it's done.\n\nVictor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh\nand by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the\ne-mail on yesterday.  Sorry.  I thought that I knew you.

I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out\nthere, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The\ntrack id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece\nuntil I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is\nextended for days 10/6 and 10/19.\n\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 10:51 AM\nTo: Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:\nSubject: Re: Enerfin meter 980439 for 10/00\n\nArre you saying that for both days that two (2) ENA contracts should be\nplaced at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the\ntotal volume to each contract?\n\nTo: Jackie Young/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Enerfin meter 980439 for 10/00\n\nJackie,\nYou did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave\nyou was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the\npurchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA,\nthat is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the\ninterconnect report.\n\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 10:30 AM\nTo: Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Alfonso Trabulsi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gregg\nLenart/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Enerfin meter 980439 for 10/00\n\nAccounting arrangement has been placed.

This year we have been asked to increase our velocity of capital, cash flow, and our return on equity.  Corporate charges need to provide the correct incentives to accomplish this.\n\nI suggest that you use the \"cost of capital charge\" as a model to allocate cost that can be re-assessed and re-allocated at least at mid-year.  Given that this year is waning, I suggest that you absorb \"freed up\" insurance capacity at the corp level.  I imagine that if a business unit purchased an asset mid-year it would bear an allocation of insurance cost, so why not provide a savings when an asset is sold?\n\nI will call to set up a time we can meet.\n\nRegards,\nBrian\n\nP.S.

My comments/questions were:\n\nWhat is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as\nagent for the client?  What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the\ntrade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable?  The margin will secure the\nrisk between treansaction and confirmation with the counterparty.  the broker\nwill pay liquidated damages if counterparty does not accept the trade.  (risk\nis essentially 1-3 days)\n\nI assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker,\ncovering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to\nbind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of\nagent/liability of agent/margin arrangements)  Yes.

We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.\n\n2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.\n\nI don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.\n\nPlease give me a call or e-mail me.

Currently Unify is adding all excess volume for each day\nand pricing the first 10,000 at a certain price and anything over 10,000 at a\ndifferent price.  For example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first, meter\n1384 may have 5000, and meter 1552 may have 5000.  Unify currently prices the\nfirst 10,000 at a certain price, and 5000 at a different price.  This is\nincorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10,000, each meter should be\npriced at the first tier level.  Robert needs to set up one additional sale\nticket and one additional buyback ticket, but he will not schedule gas to\nthese tickets.  Anita Luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when\nshe allocates the volumes each month.  Equistar receives manual invoices each\nmonth because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice,\nand they also need to have each meter invoiced separately.  I need to have\nthese tickets set up to clean up my Unify draft invoices.\n\nThanks,\nTina Valadez\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tina Valadez/HOU/ECT on 04/07/2000 08:13\nAM ---------------------------\n\nTina Valadez\n04/06/2000 01:01 PM\nTo: Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert E Lloyd/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Equistar Deal Tickets\n\nAre you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets\nfor Equistar?

The extrinsic value is the value that is obtained through rolling your hedges with other months get cheaper and more expensive than the hedged month.\n\nExample:\n\nInjection season - April through October baseload any 1 month\nWithdrawal season - Novemberr through October baseload any 1 month\n\n\tMonth\t\tPrice\t\tVol\n\tApril\t\t3.09\t\t45%\n\tMay\t\t3.11\t\t40.75%\n\tJune\t\t3.154\t\t38.25%\n\tJuly\t\t3.204\t\t38%\n\tAugust\t\t3.249\t\t38%\n\tSeptember\t3.25\t\t38%\n\tOctober\t\t3.265\t\t37.5%\n\n\tNovember\t3.42\t\t37.5%\n\tDecember\t3.59\t\t37.5%\n\tJanuary\t\t3.68\t\t37.5%\n\tFebruary\t3.565\t\t36%\n\tMarch\t\t3.446\t\t34.25%\n\nExcluding pv issues, the value of this storage should be $3.68-$3.09=$.59 plus some extrinsic value.  What is the extrinsic value?  I think we should simulate prices for each month using the current implied vol and also some correlation from a correlation matrix that we build.  Then with these simulations we calculate how much we would have made rolling hedges between now and the end of storage and the average of these simulations is the extrinsic value, right?\n\nIs this logical?  Am I being too simplistic?  Please let me know and maybe we can start with a model to price this.\n\nGeorge why don't you start with a model that simply simulates price for the months and let me know what you need in order to do this.  I think that the simulation is similar to a VAR calculation (vols and correlation ...)\n\nThanks.\n\nJohn"}, {"mid": 8, "parent": null, "author": "Sanchez, Christina CSANCHE", "time": "2001-12-18T07:04:03Z", "lang": null, "text": "Since the Stingray gas never showed up, the withdrawals were higher than I thought.\n\nHere is the corrected sheet."}], "summary": "The email thread discusses the valuation of a storage deal using a Monte Carlo simulation.

One variance was intentional, but the other was not.  In any case I had to\n\t\tmanually schedule volumes at Transcolorado and Northwest for Sempra's CR 27848 and 27342, respectively due to\n\t\tdownstream confirmation cuts.\n\nEVE:\t\tAll the points looked okay with the minor exception of Transcolorado.\n\nOTHER:\tThe Force Majeure at Bisti looks like it will continue for 5 to 6 weeks.  Since San Juan will likely be cut every cycle,\n\t\twe need to allocate the NGPL points, Gray, Eddy, and Winkler even if San Juan does not appear on the original \t\t\tallocation list.  By allocating these points, the bogus volume at Northwest delivery will disappear, and then San Juan \t\tshould come up for allocation.

Can someone review the critical notice posted on the internet for the LaPlata Compressor Station for April 2-5 with\n\t\tDarrell.  The affected customer list shows Red Cedar's points on the 2nd, but not on the 3rd through 5th.  Kim Thomas\n\t\twith Red Cedar does not know if her points will or will not be affected.  Please call her tomorrow morning if possible to\n\t\tverify the posting.\n\t\t3.  Sempra's CR 26816 was adjusted Friday, 3/15, to have Calpine be a primary delivery point for 14,000/day; \t\t\thowever, an error within CMS has kept the point as a secondary delivery and is being allocated by San Juan FMJ.  I \t\t\thave sent an e-mail to Dennis, but could someone follow-up with him to see that it gets fixed.  You may also have to \t\t\"touch\" the nom to have the change take effect in TMS.  Jim will ask probably to extend the change in primary points \t\tfor a longer period of time since the Bisti compressor may be down for 5 to 6 weeks.\n\t\t4.

Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions\n\nBased on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20\nswaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=\n=20\nflows should not be subject to withholding tax.

Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes\n\nAlthough Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=\nre=20\ngenerally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20\ntransactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20\nimposes various kinds of excise taxes.

Collateral for Derivatives Transactions\n\nIf Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20\nconnection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20\narrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20\nEnron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=\n=20\npays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20\nwithholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.\n\nAustralian Tax Advice\n\n1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions\n\nBased on the summaries of the products attached to Justin Timothy=01,s June=\n 12th=20\ne-mail to Mario Parra Cardoso and Dale Neuner:\n\n(1) the swap income or deduction should be recognized on a due and payable=\n=20\nbasis (rather than on an accrual basis over the term of the swap), and\n(2) there should not be any interest withholding tax imposed on the swap=20\npayments because there does not appear to be any linkage between the swap=\n=20\npayment and \"interest\" as defined for Australian tax purposes.\n\nNote that there is an Australian tax proposal to impose withholding tax on=\n=20\nother Australian source income.

Thus, based on the current proposal, it is unlikely that such a=\n=20\nwithholding tax, if enacted, would apply to the swap payments.

There will be\ndifferent GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is\nplanned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the\nEnron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian\nState) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only\ndifferences currently relate to different data sources.\n\nThere may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to\naccommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the\nincorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to\nensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the\npossibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore\nalthough any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a\ncounterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a\ntransaction would be relevant.\n\nHowever, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for\nconformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated\ncompany may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude\nderivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs\nthe appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular\nJapanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that\nis currently followed.\n\nAccordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese\nweather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff.\n\nFrom: Alan Aronowitz@ECT on 14-07-2000 09:40 CDT\nTo: Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: David Forster/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Justin\nTimothy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Leonardo\nPacheco/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, David\nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n\nSubject: Re: EOL GTC's for Weather Derivatives In Australia\n\nWe are currently having the GTCs for Australian weather reviewed by local\ncounsel in Japan for conformity to Japanese law.

Ltd.\n\nRegards, Alan\n\n\tDale Neuner\n\t07/14/2000 08:48 AM\n\n\t\t To: David Forster/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Justin\nTimothy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Leonardo Pacheco/Corp/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc:\n\t\t Subject: Re: EOL GTC's for Weather Derivatives In Australia\n\nI think there is some confusion here.

It seems to me that we both need to\nfinalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that\nwe all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of\nnext week.\n\n1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap\nstructure including the credit and covenant package.\n\n2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have\none prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global\nFinance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its\nexternal counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements,\ndocuments, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or\nexchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among\neach other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless\nand until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and\nfinancial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations\nare, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For\nexample:\n\n (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee\nthey were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to\naccept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking\nfor a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and\nwarranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon\nthis disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may\nhave a problem to resolve.

X-default of a generic nature referencing any Enron swap transaction over\na certain threshold amount.  As it is essentiaIly an Enron Corp. credit, I\nwould fiercely oppose this, but it is a commercial issue.  If it is to be\nincluded, the issue is not the occurrence of the event of default, but\nexercise of termination as a result of an event of default, and then only if\nthe exercise of the right of termination is finally determined to have been\nvalidly exercised.  But as I say, I would tell the Bank to get stuffed.\n\n2.  X-default to Enron Corp. Credit Agreement.  Again this is a commercial\nissue, but if the Bank is getting the longer form Guarantee this is not\nnecessary.  This could however fix to the requirement for the longer form\nGuarantee, if the Bank will take a plain vanilla short form Enron Corp.\nGuarantee with the x-default.  In any event, if this concept is to be\nincluded, it similarly would need to be qualified to acceleration as a result\nof an event of default under the Enron Corp. Credit Facilities.  Frankly, if\nClement is prepared on the longer form Enron Corp. Guarantee, I would tell\nthe Bank to get stuffed.\n\n3.  X-Default if the Enron Corp. Credit Agreement is determined to be\nunenforceable.  Unless I am missing something, this is ridiculous.\n\n4.  The Bank wants to \"syndicate\" the exposure which might include Schedule\nII Canadian Chartered Banks, and which might increase the Bank's cost of\nfunding.  Therefore they want to build a price escalator into the swaps.\nAgain, this is a business issue, but if it is to be included it will be a\ndifficult concept in the context of the swaps, as opposed to a syndicated\nloan.  The price escalator will be complicated enough, as well as\nincorporating syndication rights and obligations on terms satisfactory to\nEnron, such as to which financial institutions, % of permitted syndication,\nleast cost alternatives, exercise of agent and majority rights, and recourse\nfor defaults by the Bank (i.e. unlike a loan we are taking credit risk of the\nBank as counterparty on the swaps).\n\nThe Bank's counsel did not seem to want to give a legal opinion on the Bank\nbut was willing on Swapco.  I would insist on getting it from the Bank, as\nagain this is not a loan but a swap on which we are taking the Bank's credit\nexposure.

The department buys electricity fo=\nr=20\nthe state's financially distressed utilities.=20\n\"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=\nn=20\nover the FERC order,\" Hidalgo said. \"We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear.\"=20\nThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20\nCalifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20\nRolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20\nMost California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20\nvariable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=\n=20\nmarket. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=\nng=20\nprofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=\n=20\nAnd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=\n=20\nwill fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20\n\"That's the risk that you run (with price controls),\" said Arthur O'Donnell=\n,=20\neditor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. \"People want any kind o=\nf=20\ncertainty at all.\"=20\nHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=\ns=20\nfrom the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=\nts=20\ngovernment-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=\n=20\nwent into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=\ne=20\nordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20\nThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20\nFERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20\nprice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=\n=20\nplant operating in California during a \"power alert\" declared by the=20\nIndependent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=\n.=20\nWhen there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=\n=20\nestablished during the latest alert.=20\nUntil Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=\nn=20\nCalifornia. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20\nafternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20\npercent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20\nBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20\nCalifornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=\n=20\nby how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20\nThe ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=\n98=20\nin two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20\npremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=\nit=20\nrisk in selling to the state.=20\nO'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=\n=20\ntime the ISO declares a power alert.=20\nIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=\nt=20\nout-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the=20\nout-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20\n\nThe Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co=\nm.=20\n\nPower Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20\nElectricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to=\n=20\nsell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20\n\nBy NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20\n\n?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted=20\nseveral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=\n=20\nafternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.\n?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to=20\nsupply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the=20\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the=\n=20\nstate's electricity since January.\n?????At least five companies producing or marketing power \"are telling us=\n=20\nthat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not goin=\ng=20\nto take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,\" Hart said.\n?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in=\n=20\nsummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,=\n=20\nmeaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since=\n=20\nMay 31.\n?????Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20\nintended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=\ner=20\nemergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that=20\napplies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20\n?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=\ne=20\nmost inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=\n=20\ngrid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\n?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =\nis=20\nsupposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparentl=\ny=20\ndrove away sellers, Hart said.\n?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=\n=20\nthe old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=\nd=20\ncommitted to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=20\nbacked out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=\n=20\nOregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit =\nof=20\nthe San Diego-based energy conglomerate.\n?????Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =\na=20\nStage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy=20\ncommission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be a=\nnd=20\nwhen it should take effect.

Each mile that electrici=\nty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20\n\"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,\" said=\n Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e=\nnergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20\nAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =\nno economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont=\nrols are in effect.=20\n\"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=\nt having enough,\" Ackerman said. \"It increases the threat of blackouts.\"=20\nBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED\nCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when =\npower reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab=\nout an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20\n\"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,\" said Stephanie McCorkle, =\na spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee=\ns the state's power network.=20\nThe Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after=\n Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting=\n heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li=\nghts.=20\nDon Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=\nt the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th=\ney are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had=\n in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20\n\"We're looking very closely at this,\" he said. \"There seems to be a potenti=\nal for unintended consequences.\"=20\nSpecifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=\n- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin=\ng, under capped prices.=20\n\"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,\" he said.=20\nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=\n2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because=\n of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20\nAckerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=\nve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20\n\"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,\" he said.=\n=20\n'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20\nCalifornia and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t=\nhat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal=\n regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit=\nhhold output.=20\n\"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),\"=\n said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20\nUnfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=\n that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal r=\negulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let suppl=\ny and demand determine costs.=20\nHidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac=\nk on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu=\nmber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge=\nncies.=20\n\"No one answered,\" he said. \"They were closed.\"=20\nState officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the com=\nmission would look into the matter.

The department buys electricity fo=\nr the state's financially distressed utilities.=20\n\"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=\nn over the FERC order,\" Hidalgo said. \"We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear.\"=\n=20\nThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca=\nlifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll=\ning blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20\nMost California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia=\nble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark=\net. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p=\nrofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A=\nnd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap =\nwill fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20\n\"That's the risk that you run (with price controls),\" said Arthur O'Donnell=\n, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. \"People want any kind=\n of certainty at all.\"=20\nHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=\ns from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark=\nets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s=\ntate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou=\nts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20\nThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20\nFERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=\nice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=\nlant operating in California during a \"power alert\" declared by the Indepen=\ndent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When =\nthere's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=\nished during the latest alert.=20\nUntil Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=\nn California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=\nrnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent=\n of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20\nBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=\nornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=\now much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20\nThe ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=\n98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =\npremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=\nit risk in selling to the state.=20\nO'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=\nime the ISO declares a power alert.=20\nIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=\nt out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou=\nt-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20\n\nThe Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co=\nm .=20\n\nPower Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20\nElectricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s=\nell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20\n\nBy NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20\n\n     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev=\neral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af=\nternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.\n     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su=\npply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif=\nornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat=\ne's electricity since January.\n     At least five companies producing or marketing power \"are telling us t=\nhat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going=\n to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,\" Hart said.\n     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s=\nummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m=\neaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since =\nMay 31.\n     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=\nnded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=\nmergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=\nes to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20\n     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=\ne most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=\n grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\n     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =\nis supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=\nntly drove away sellers, Hart said.\n     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=\n the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=\nad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=\n backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=\n Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=\n of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.\n     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =\na Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=\nssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=\nen it should take effect. They got no answer.\n     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=\nify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=\nuppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.\n     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=\nt is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=\nce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=\ntely.\n     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =\nhad anticipated.

I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with \"adequate assurance\" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGraham, Charlie\nSent:\tTuesday, December 11, 2001 5:05 PM\nTo:\tRice, Randy; Gilbert, Tom\nCc:\tRapp, Bill; Brassfield, Morris; Dushinske, John; Fancler, Dan; Miller, Mary Kay; Marion, Pierre; Centilli, James; Porter, J.

I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with \"adequate assurance\" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGraham, Charlie\nSent:\tTuesday, December 11, 2001 5:05 PM\nTo:\tRice, Randy; Gilbert, Tom\nCc:\tRapp, Bill; Brassfield, Morris; Dushinske, John; Fancler, Dan; Miller, Mary Kay; Marion, Pierre; Centilli, James; Porter, J.

My blood pressure has eased so=\nmewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level =\nmore consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers wa=\nnt to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further sq=\nueeze the cost bundle.\n =20\nHere's a quick recap-\n\n$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open seaso=\nn.\n$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season=\n.\n$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc\n\nThe difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM. =20\n\nOf this, $218 MM relates to-\n\n-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)\n-[$44] MM for 36\" pipe vs 30\" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to=\n be confirmed by the engineers.\n-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)\n-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition\n-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in=\n original estimate)\n-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the =\noriginal scope)\n\nWe can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original pro=\nject scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won=\n't overbuild with 36\" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippe=\nrs pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future =\nshippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the =\namount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying=\n anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on =\nfinding other potential savings.\n\nThe remaining $109 MM comes under the category of \"identified risks\".  Esti=\nmates are provided in current dollars and the \"escalation\" component highli=\nghts the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little re=\ncent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs f=\nor Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discuss=\nions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - =\n- seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust."}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Howard, Kevin A.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=\n=20\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\n =20\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\n=20\nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\nly=20\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\neased=20\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.

The resul=\nt,=20\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\n=20\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\n=20\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\n=20\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\n=20\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\nng=20\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\nn=20\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\ne=20\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\nt=20\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\ned=20\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\nle=20\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\nion. =20\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\n=20\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\n=20\nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\n=20\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\nhich,=20\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron=01,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\nix=20\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\n=20\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\n=20\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\ne=20\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\nts=20\nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\n=20\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\n=20\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\n=20\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\n of our=20\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\nly=20\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\nto=20\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\n=20\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\n=20\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\n=20\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\ners=20\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\n=20\ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\n, the=20\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\net=20\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\n=20\nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\ns=20\nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=\ny=20\nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\n=20\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=\n=20\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\n=20\nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=\n=20\nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\nd=20\nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=\n.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\n=20\nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=\nds=20\nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\n. =20\nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\nir=20\nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20\ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\n=20\narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=\ner=20\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\n=20\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\n=20\nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\n,=20\nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\n=20\nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=\ned;=20\nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\n,=20\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20\nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\nit=20\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\ney=20\nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\n=20\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=\n=20\nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=\ns=20\nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\nhe=20\ncrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=\n will=20\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\nsolutions to the state."}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Gerald Nemec", "time": "2001-03-13T11:05:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "----- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 03/13/2001 07:04 PM -----\n\n=09Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling@ENRON\n=09Sent by: Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling@ENRON\n=0903/13/2001 04:17 PM\n=09=09=20\n=09=09 To: All Enron Worldwide\n=09=09 cc:=20\n=09=09 Subject: California Energy Crisis\n\nCalifornia=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=\nral=20\nmonths.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=\n=20\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\n =20\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\n=20\nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\nly=20\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\neased=20\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=\n=20\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=\nt,=20\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\n=20\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\n=20\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\n=20\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\n=20\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\nng=20\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\nn=20\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\ne=20\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\nt=20\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\ned=20\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\nle=20\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\nion. =20\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\n=20\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\n=20\nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\n=20\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\nhich,=20\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron=01,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\nix=20\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\n=20\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\n=20\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\ne=20\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\nts=20\nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\n=20\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\n=20\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\n=20\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\n of our=20\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\nly=20\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\nto=20\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\n=20\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\n=20\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\n=20\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\ners=20\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\n=20\ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\n, the=20\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\net=20\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\n=20\nshort of Byzantine.

I enjoyed reading the document.\n\nA few comments:\n\n1) I would stress the importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implementaion of wholesale markets. RTO participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well. You included some elements of this topic under the title \"An Installed capacity requirement is not necessary\" . It does  fit under this title, but I think it is more than that. Perhaps a separate item.  A few possible additional points:\n\ta) Demand response has been very limited so far, because customers have been under a regulatory shield:\n\tb) A few attempts to make load \"see\" correct prices have been very encouraging. There is still a long way to go, though.\n\tc) There has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices (e.g. DSB)\n\td) Wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways, such as: (i) increased chances for the market to clear at all times (ii) mitigate price spikes - and as a consequence the need for caps; (iii) proxy for reserves\n\te) It will take some time to get demand response. In the meantime, some interim measures may be necessary, such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments (your footnote 11 to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level).\n\tf) Even for this interim period, we do not support  caps. By not having caps, the rationale for capacity payment disappears. FERC will deal with market power, if any, on an ad-hoc basism, by not allowing market based rates, instead of caps. This is the approach MISO has been taking and we agreed with it.\n\n2) What about including the text \"A well designed RTO\" as an attachment?  - the one recently prepared by Janel.\n\n3) Hydro - I agree with your point that LMP may work in a  hydro based system.  The only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade. In that case, plants are not free to bid - there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management.  The \"marginal\"  price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process, but it is the shadow price of an optimization program. This very same price could be the basis for the LMP. Not a big deal. Hydro plants do not like LMP because, in general, they are far away from consumer centers and LMP with technical losses penalizes them a lot. We should stick to our point that LMP should be used across all RTOs.\n\n4) Still on LMP on the northwest - (page 10, second paragraph). I agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out. For example,  generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum (or maximum) requirements. However, I would not call this \"allowing bilateral contracts\". I would call it accomodate \"must run\"  requirements caused by operational inflexibilities. (for example, if a run of river plant  decides to be merchant, it still should have  the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run)\n\n5) Still on LMP for hydro. I am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the Northwest RTO. Steve Walton to confirm. Otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page 10. I think David suggested to use the NY example (I am not familiar with)\n\n6) Capacity Payment - Page 12 - last paragraph. \"Finally, any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a specitc generator (as a physical product)\". I know what you meant, but it may lead to dubious  interpretations. It may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures. If we were able to get property rights on reliability issues, the capacity fee discussion wouuld be a no-brainer.  I would eliminate the sentence.\n\n7) Capacity Payment - Page 12 - last paragraph - our white paper on capacity (footnote 11) does not clearly say that the RTO should the purchasing agent during the interim period. It may be the case (provider of last resource), but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution. What we can certainly say is that in the interim period the RTO should be responsible for system adequacy - plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all Control Areas (as opposed to having each one of them working independently)\n\nSorry for the long e-mail. I hope it helps.\n\nLM\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNovosel, Sarah\nSent:\tTuesday, November 20, 2001 12:50 PM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Robertson, Linda; Nord, Sue; Landwehr, Susan M.; Walton, Steve; Perrino, Dave; Comnes, Alan; Lindberg, Susan; Maurer, Luiz; Fromer, Howard; Hoatson, Tom; Allegretti, Daniel; Staines, Dan; Yeung, Charles; Shelk, John; Rodriquez, Andy\nCc:\tNicolay, Christi L.\nSubject:\tRTO Comments\n\nAttached are draft RTO comments.
