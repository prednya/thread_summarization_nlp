Here is the current status as we\n> understand it.  Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,\n> 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron\n> Entities have made the following document productions in response to the\n> subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the\n> \"Commission\"):\n>\n> * October 13, 2000  Bate Nos. Enron Entities 000001-000025 on behalf\n> of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-11, 20.\n>\n> * October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P000001-002115 on behalf of Portland\n> General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.\n>\n> * November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 000026 (Diskette with\n> EES/EEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 11, 13, 15 to 17,\n> and 19.\n>\n> * November 15, 2000 Bate No. P002116-002117 (Diskettes with Portland\n> General Data, which include approximate 355,000 wholesale transactions)\n> Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 11, 13 to 17, and 19.\n>\n> We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October\n> 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEMC.  As you\n> know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights\n> to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,\n> objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.\n>\n>  We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for\n> EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by\n> October 27th.  However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation\n> that any data provided be useful and reliable.  The collection of data you\n> requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same\n> location nor organized as you requested it.  In fact during our review of\n> some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the\n> methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.\n> When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it\n> would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,\n> we informed you of the problem.  We now understand that if we cannot give\n> you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be\n> available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to\n> compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission\n> (\"FERC\").  We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data\n> immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the\n> immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce\n> accurate data.\n>\n>  Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number\n> of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas\n> served on the Enron entities.  First, we understand that many other\n> parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the\n> detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very\n> sound legal grounds.  Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing\n> on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is\n> supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes\n> sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its\n> motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data\n> from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited\n> hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the\n> motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially\n> different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application\n> to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.\n> Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a\n> tentative order as of November 1, 2000.\n>\n>  Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most\n> favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests\n> by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that\n> was available.  However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need\n> for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite\n> substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate\n> Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described\n> intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal\n> objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's\n> threatened motion to compel before FERC.\n>\n>  We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission\n> has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been\n> served with subpoenas.  We understand that there is a list for those\n> entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been\n> delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their\n> rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We understand that the Commission\n> intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that\n> object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We deplore\n> these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described\n> above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating\n> list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.\n>\n>  If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to\n> contact me.\n>\n>         Sincerely,\n>\n>\n>\n>         Gary S.\n> Fergus\n\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may\ncontain confidential and privileged information.

I know there is probably so much you wanted to say, but for sound business reasons simply can not share today.  To be honest, I did walk away not fully motivated for the next struggle.

As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.

The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a\npersonal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a\nreal treat.\n\nReceiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It is\ndifficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers\nof amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I have\nthe greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.\n\nOne regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my\ndeparture as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn't\never wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are\nexperiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.\n\nOne factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses\nI've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feeling\nof despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept\nof an \"open door\" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in my\nopinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective\nview and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carry\nany weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination\nthat is all too common at EES.\n\nThough my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees\n(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company\nand am proud to have been a part of Enron.\n\nThe shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this\npast spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career\nopportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and\nunfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to\nmove on.\n\nKen, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult\ntime.

As many of you are aware, the\nenvironmental market is quickly changing and expanding with a growing\ncorrelation between energy efficiency, renewable energy, air emissions, and\nnew technology developments.  Given our vast industry expertise and\ncomprehensive service, Enron has a significant advantage to meet these market\ndemands, which present both wholesale and retail opportunities.\n\nFor those of you that can attend, please RSVP by sending in a short\ndescription of what you do, and any suggestions to the below tentative agenda\nby Friday, September 8th.   I'll circulate these descriptions to those who\nhave RSVPd along with a finalized agenda.   The location is TBD.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-9916.\nStacey Bolton\n\nTENTATIVE AGENDA\nIntroductions\n Brief introductions including what you do for Enron and its related\nenvironmental issues\n Update on what each of the Enron groups are doing related to environmental\nmarket opportunities\nState of the Environmental Market, updates on:\n Size of the market\n Emission and Green Premiums\n Customer demand for environmental products\n Mandates and Incentive Funds\n Credit trading programs\n Utility and competitors renewable product offerings\n Governments' efforts to \"go green\"\n Current and pending air regulatory compliance issues\nConcepts for discussion\n Upcoming bids/commercial partnering opportunities\n Trading Renewable Credits and Emissions Nationwide/Worldwide\n Regulatory issues - Hot spots\n Launching Environmental Product Offerings\n  Potential products:\n  -synthetic green energy product\n  -100% wind green credits\n  -new regulatory/compliance/risk management products\n  -bundled environmental performance improvement products"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Jeff Dasovich", "time": "2000-09-15T04:35:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "My apologies, but as you can imagine, California's little crisis has me a bit\npreoccupied.

Therefore, before working with Peter Chamberlain\nmake sure that the DPCA is funding him from dues and not an assessment that\nwe might end up having to pay for (I think Peter may not be retained by DPCA\nsince the DPCA is restructuring including looking at substantial increase in\ndues).  Just be very clear who is paying for Peter and understand our\nfinancial liability before you commence any effort with him (I could be wrong\nbut I'd rather err on the side of conservancy).\n\nI would be happy to take a look at what AEP/APS are proposing as long as\nthere's no immediate time frame.

Their \"angle\" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.\n\nAs you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.\n\nThere are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this \"retail\" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.\n\nThese developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:\n\n1.  Power Marketing and Project development\n2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access\n3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise\n\nGiven the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.\n\nTherefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.\n\nPlease give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.

Ben and I had a meeting with Scott this morning. Basic idea is to have 3\nand 5 year tolling agreement with Calpine and sell to the market after the\nexpiration of the  agreement.\n\n2. Ben prepared a preliminary model. Scott's target unlevered equity IRR is\n8.5% ~ 9%. Key value driver will be a capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 or\n5 years, which we will charge to Calpine. As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC,\nwe will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.\n\n3. Things to be done\n - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity\n - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas\ncurve.\n - VOM\n\nI think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what\nwe see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up\nmore by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement. This is just my\nthought. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I will continue to work on the\nmodel with Ben and I will talk to Scott to find out more.

The pane=\nlists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=\n--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =\nPower Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =\nSteve Walton--Enron.\nGeneral Observations\nThe Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=\nime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=\nuestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=\nal presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=\nas some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=\ner, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=\nion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=\nTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=\nere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=\nle that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=\ne was a good deal of discussion of \"least cost planning\" and the identifica=\ntion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=\no be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=\ns who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20\nOpening Statements\nJose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=\nerator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =\nwere formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=\n asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=\nvestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20\nMichael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=\ns all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=\ns requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=\na of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=\ns, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=\ned by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=\n must be considered.\nMark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =\nconsidering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =\nwith their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=\ncess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =\nthe future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.\nLaura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=\ns the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=\nsources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=\neds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=\n should decide on solutions. =20\nMasheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =\nabout hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=\nave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=\nn conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=\nwered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=\nion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=\nansions? =20\nSteve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =\nsettle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=\nas frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =\nyears or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =\nneeds to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=\nou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=\n8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =\nright-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=\n.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=\npute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.\nDiscussion\nKevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=\nestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=\n  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=\n with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =\nuse of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=\n this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=\nion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=\n they can make intelligent decisions. =20\nCommissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =\nneeded lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=\nion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=\nies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =\nprocess.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=\naura Manz felt that the term \"under built\" is a secondary effect of not hav=\ning proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.\nDick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=\nt.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=\nydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=\n of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=\not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=\nl but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=\n but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some \"twea=\nks\" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=\nt  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=\nimize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =\nbut not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =\nsuch thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=\nnd base load coal.\nIn the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=\n RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=\nhould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =\nwas over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=\nritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =\ninvolved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=\nnce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=\nity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =\npoint really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =\ntension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.\nSteve"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Black, Tamara Jae TBLACK", "time": "2001-10-18T09:14:50Z", "lang": null, "text": "=20\n\n  RTO Week\nDay 2 -- October 16, 2001\nTransmission Planning & Expansion\nThe afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion.

Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=\n of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=\not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=\nl but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=\n but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some \"twea=\nks\" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=\nt  river coordination.

The disagreement =\nwas over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=\nritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =\ninvolved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=\nnce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=\nity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =\npoint really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =\ntension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.\nSteve"}], "summary": "The panel discussed transmission planning and expansion.

Not\na single cloud in the sky. About 70\ndegrees.\n11:55 I decide that we're going to kick\nthe shit out\nof Nebraska.\n11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to\ngo fuck\nhimself.\n12:15 The UT band walks by on the way\nto the\nAlamodome. We're on the second floor of\na two-story\nparking garage on the corner (a couple\nhundred of us).\nWe're hooting and hollering like\nwildmen. The band\ndoubles back to the street right below\nus and\nserenades us with Texas Fight and The\nEyes of Texas.\nAWESOME MOMENT.\n12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,\n50-100 grown\nmen are bumping chests with one\nanother, each and\nevery one of them now secure and\ncertain of the fact\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska.\n1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the\nway to the\nAlamodome. Again, we hoot and holler\nlike wildmen.\nAgain, the band doubles back and stops\nright below us\nto serenade us, this time, however,\nwith the Nebraska\nfight songs. Although somewhat\nimpressed by their\nspirit and verve, we remain convinced\nthat we are\ngoing to kick the shit out of\nNebraska.\n1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,\nsomehow\nmanaging to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11\ncans of beer\ninto my pants.\n1:47 I am in line surrounded by\nNebraska fans. They\nare taunting me. I am taunting back,\nstill certain\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska. I\ndecide to challenge a particularly\nvocal Nebraska fan\nto play what I now call and will\nforever be remembered\nas \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop\nout for a\ndollar? The rules are similar. I tell\nthis Nebraska\njackass that if he's so confident in\nhis team, he\nshould \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT\nNOW and make\nplane reservations to Phoenix for the\nFiesta Bowl.\nAnd then I spoke these memorable words:\n\"And not\nthose\ndamn refundable tickets, either! You\nrequest those\nnon-refundable, non-transferrable\nsons-of-bitches!\"\nHe backs down. He is unworthy. I call\nSouthwest\nAirlines and buy two tickets to\nPhoenix,\nnon-refundable\nand non-transferrable. Price: $712. He\nis humbled.\nHe lowers his head in shame. I raise my\ncell phone in\ntriumph to the cheers of hundreds of\nTexas fans. I am\nKING and these are my subjects. I\ndistribute the 11\nbeers in my pants to the cheering\nmasses. I RULE the\npre-game kingdom.\n2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,\nI open the\nTraveler and pour my first stiffy.\n2:45 I notice something troubling:\nNebraska is big.\nNebraska is fast. Nebraska is very\npissed off at\nTexas.\n3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.\n9 yards\ntotal offense for Texas. Zero first\ndowns for Texas.\nI'm still talking shit. I pour\nanother stiffy from\nthe Traveler.\n3:36 Four minutes to go in the first\nhalf: the\nTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy my\nfirst $5 beer\nfrom the Alamodome merchants. While I\nam standing in\nline, a center snap nearly decapitates\nMajor\nApplewhite\nand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.\n3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas\n0. I wish I\nhad another Traveler.\n4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska\nfan in the\nbathroom at halftime, I attempt to\nrevive the classic\nBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\n\"Hey, buddy,\nniiiiiiiiice cock.\" He is\nunamused.\n4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from\nthe Alamodome\nmerchants. I share my beer with two\nhigh school girls\nsitting behind me. Surprisingly, they\nare equipped\nwith a flask full of vodka. I send them\noff to\npurchase $5 Sprites, so that we may\nconsume their\nvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska\nis a bunch of\npussies.\n4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting\nbehind me have\nfled for their lives. I purchase two\nmore $5 beers\nfrom the Alamodome merchants.\n5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I\nam beginning\nto lose faith. This normally would\ntrouble me, but I\nam too drunk to see the football field.\n\n5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm\nsorry, sir.\nThose tickets have been confirmed and\nare\nnon-refundable and non-transferrable.\"\n5:37 I try to start a fight with every\nperson behind\nthe concession counter. As it turns\nout, the\nAlamodome has a policy that no beer can\nbe sold when\nthere is less than 10 minutes on the\ngame clock. I am\nenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:\n\"Why the fuck\ndidn't you announce last call over the\nfucking PA\nsystem??!!\"\n5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in\nmy chair in\ndefeat. All of a sudden, the Texas\ncrowd goes\nabsolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter,\nawaking from\nmy coma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\"\nAlas, the\nanswer is no, we were not winning and\nwe did not\nscore.\nThe largest (by far) cheer of the day\nfrom the Texas\nfaithful occurred when the handlers\nwere walking back\nto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take\na gargantuan\nshit all over the letters \"S\",\n\"K\", and \"A\" in the\n\"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end\nzone. I cheer\nwildly. I pick up the empty Traveler\nbottle and stick\nmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.\n6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as\nI walk back\nto the truck. I would taunt them with\nsome off-color\nremarks about their parentage, but I am\ntoo drunk to\nform complete sentences. With my last\ncognitive\nthought of the evening, I take solace\nin the fact that\nif we had not beaten them in October,\nthey would be\nplaying Florida State for the national\nchampionship.\n6:30 Back in the car. On the way back\nto Austin for\nthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can\nstill salvage\nthe day! I crack open a beer. It is\nwarm. I don't\ncare.\n7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am\nhungry. I go\ninside the store. I walk past the beer\nfrig. I\nnotice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I\nwonder if\nit's any good. I pull a Zima from the\nfrig. I twist\nthe top off and drink the Zima in three\nswallows.\nZima\nsucks. I replace the empty bottle in\nthe frig.\n7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the\nstore. I walk to\nwhere the ingredients are, where the\nperson usually\nmakes the sub. There is no one there. I\nlean over\nthe counter and scoop out half a bucket\nof black\nolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.\nI lean\nfurther over the counter and grab\napproximately two\npounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the\nstore\ngrunting and eating Pastrami. The\npatrons in the\nstore fear me. I don't care.\n8:01 We are in South Austin. I have\nbeen drinking\nwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn\ntunes for over\nan hour. My truck-mate is tired of my\nsinging. He\nsuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn\nhave written\nother good songs besides \"You're Going\nto Miss Me When\nI'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" and that\nmaybe listening to\nonly those two songs, ten times each\nwas a bit\nexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I\ncould just let the\nCD play on its own. I tell him to\nfuck off and\nrestart \"Neon Moon.\"\n8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My\ntruckmate,\nagainst my loud and profane\nprotestations, parks on\nthe top floor of a nearby parking\ngarage. I tell him\nhe's an idiot. I tell him we will never\nget out. I\ntell him we may as well pitch a\nfucking tent here. He\nignores me. I think he's still pissed\nabout the\nBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon\nMoon\" loudly.\n8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers\nstuffed in\nmy pants. We're going to kick the\nshit out of\nArizona.\n9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona\n29. I am\npleased. I go to the bathroom to pee\nfor the 67th\ntime today. I giggle to myself because\nof the\nnew opportunity to do \"the bathroom\nBrice.\" There are\nno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am\ndisappointed.\nI tell myself (out loud) that I have a\n\"Niiiiiice\ncock.\" No one is amused but me.\n9:41 I walk to the bathroom while\ndrinking Bud Light\nout of a can. Needless to say, they do\nnot sell beer\nat the Erwin Center, much less Bud\nLight out of a can.\nI am stopped by an usher: \"Where did\nyou get\nthat, sir?\" I tell him (no shit):\n\"Oh, the\ncheerleaders were throwing them up with\nthose little\nplastic footballs. Would you mind\nthrowing this away\nfor me?\" I take the last swig and hand\nit to him. He\nis confused. I pretend I'm going to the\nbathroom, but\nI run away giggling instead. I duck\ninto some\nentrance to avoid the usher, who is now\npursuing me.\nI sneak into a large group of people\nand sit down.\nThe\nusher walks by harmlessly. I am\ngiggling like a little\ngirl. I crack open another can of Bud\nLight.\n9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid\nthe usher, I\nhave lost my bearings. I have no ticket\nstub. I\ncannot find my seats. Texas is losing.\n10:09 Texas is being screwed by the\nrefs. I am\nenraged. I have cleared out the seats\naround me\nbecause I keep removing my hat and\nbeating the\nsurrounding chairs with it. A concerned\nfan asks if\nI'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it\nso seriously.\nI tell him to fuck off.\n10:15 After the fourth consecutive\n\"worst fucking\ncall I have EVER seen,\" I attempt to\nremove my hat\nagain to begin beating inanimate\nobjects. However, on\nthis occasion I miscalculate and I\nthumbnail myself in\nmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter\ninch gash over\nmy eye. I am now bleeding into my left\neye and all\nover my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to\nmyself, \"I'm\ntaking this a bit seriously.\"\n10:22 I am standing in the bathroom\npeeing. I'm so\ndrunk I am swaying and grunting. I have\na bloody\nnapkin pressed on my left eye. My pants\nare bloody.\nI have my (formerly) white shirt\nwrapped around my\nwaist. I look like I should be in an\nepisode of Cops.\n10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody\nwhite shirt\nback on my body and make my way for the\nexits. I am\nstopped every 20 seconds by a good\nsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me\nwhy I am\ncovered in blood, but I merely grunt\nincoherently and\nkeep moving.\n10:59 With my one good eye, I have\nlocated the\nparking garage. I walk up six flights\nof stairs,\npromise that when I see my friend I\nwill punch him\nin the face for making me walk up six\nflights of\nstairs, find the truck, and collapse in\na heap in the\nbed of the truck. I look around and\nnotice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around\nthe garage, six\nwhole flights, and no one is moving. I\ntake a nap.\n11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my\nfriend in the\ndriver's seat. I lift my head to look\nout the bed of\nthe truck and notice that traffic is\nlined up all the\nway around the garage, six whole\nflights, and no one\nis\nmoving. I am too tired to punch my\nfriend. I call my\nfriend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n11:31 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:38 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:47 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:58 I am jostled. The truck is\nmoving. I lift my\nhead to look out the bed of the truck\nand notice that\ntraffic is beginning to move on the\nsecond floor. I\njump out of the truck, walk to the edge\nof the parking\nfacility, and pee off the sixth floor\nonto the street\nbelow. My friend looks at me like I\njust anally\nviolated his minor sister. I turn\naround and pee\non the front of his truck while singing\nthe lyrics\nto \"Neon Moon.\"\n12:11 We are moving. We are out of\nbeer. I jump\nfrom the truck and go from vehicle to\nvehicle until\nsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.\nI return to\nmy vehicle.\n12:26 We have emerged from the parking\nfacility. We\nmake our way to my apartment and find\nEd sitting on\nthe couch with a freshly opened bottle\nof Glenlivet on\nthe coffee table in front of him. We\nare all going to\ndie tonight.\n12:59 We have finished three-quarters\nof the bottle\nof Glenlivet. We decide it would be a\nwonderful idea\nto go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has\nto pee. He\nwalks down the hall to our apartment\nand directly into\nthe full length mirror at the end of\nthe hall,\nsmashing it into hundreds of pieces. We\ngiggle\nuncontrollably and leave for\nPollyEsther's.\n1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs\nuncontrollably\nat our efforts to enter his club.\n\"Fellas,\" he says\nin between his fits of spastic\nlaughter, \"I've been\nworking this door for almost a year.\nI've been\nworking\ndoors in this town for almost 5 years.\nAnd I can\nhonestly say that I ain't never seen\nthree drunker\nmother fuckers than you three.\nSorry, can't let you\nin.\" We attempt to reason with him. He\nlaughs\nharder.\n1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We\ntake two\nsteps in the door and hear \"Last call\nfor alcohol!\" I\nturn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat\nwasn't that\nfuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that\nat the\nAwamo...the awaom...the\nalab...fuck it, that stadium\nwe\nwas at today...\" We order 6 shots of\ntequila and\nthree beers.\n2:15 Back on the street. We need food.\nWe hail a\ncab to take us the two and one half\nblocks to Katz's.\nThe cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10\nand tell him\nto keep it.\n2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give\nthe hostess\n$50. We are seated immediately.\n2:25 We order two orders of fried\npickles, a Cobb\nsalad, a bowl of soup, two orders of\nBlueberry\nblintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a\nhamburger, two\ncheese stuffed potatoes, an order of\nfries, and an\norder of onion rings.\n2:39 The food arrives. We are all\nasleep with our\nheads on the table. The waiter wakes us\nup. We eat\nevery fucking bit of our food. Most\nof the restaurant\npatrons around us are disgusted. We\ndon't give a\nshit.\nThe tab is $112 with tip.\n2:46 I'm sleepy.\n9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.\nShe is the\nbartender at Katz's.

I send them\noff to\npurchase $5 Sprites, so that we may\nconsume their\nvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska\nis a bunch of\npussies.\n4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting\nbehind me have\nfled for their lives. I purchase two\nmore $5 beers\nfrom the Alamodome merchants.\n5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I\nam beginning\nto lose faith. This normally would\ntrouble me, but I\nam too drunk to see the football field.\n\n5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm\nsorry, sir.\nThose tickets have been confirmed and\nare\nnon-refundable and non-transferrable.\"\n5:37 I try to start a fight with every\nperson behind\nthe concession counter. As it turns\nout, the\nAlamodome has a policy that no beer can\nbe sold when\nthere is less than 10 minutes on the\ngame clock. I am\nenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:\n\"Why the fuck\ndidn't you announce last call over the\nfucking PA\nsystem??!!\"\n5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in\nmy chair in\ndefeat. All of a sudden, the Texas\ncrowd goes\nabsolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter,\nawaking from\nmy coma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\"\nAlas, the\nanswer is no, we were not winning and\nwe did not\nscore.\nThe largest (by far) cheer of the day\nfrom the Texas\nfaithful occurred when the handlers\nwere walking back\nto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take\na gargantuan\nshit all over the letters \"S\",\n\"K\", and \"A\" in the\n\"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end\nzone. I cheer\nwildly. I pick up the empty Traveler\nbottle and stick\nmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.\n6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as\nI walk back\nto the truck. I would taunt them with\nsome off-color\nremarks about their parentage, but I am\ntoo drunk to\nform complete sentences. With my last\ncognitive\nthought of the evening, I take solace\nin the fact that\nif we had not beaten them in October,\nthey would be\nplaying Florida State for the national\nchampionship.\n6:30 Back in the car. On the way back\nto Austin for\nthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can\nstill salvage\nthe day! I crack open a beer. It is\nwarm. I don't\ncare.\n7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am\nhungry. I go\ninside the store. I walk past the beer\nfrig. I\nnotice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I\nwonder if\nit's any good. I pull a Zima from the\nfrig. I twist\nthe top off and drink the Zima in three\nswallows.\nZima\nsucks. I replace the empty bottle in\nthe frig.\n7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the\nstore. I walk to\nwhere the ingredients are, where the\nperson usually\nmakes the sub. There is no one there. I\nlean over\nthe counter and scoop out half a bucket\nof black\nolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.\nI lean\nfurther over the counter and grab\napproximately two\npounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the\nstore\ngrunting and eating Pastrami. The\npatrons in the\nstore fear me. I don't care.\n8:01 We are in South Austin. I have\nbeen drinking\nwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn\ntunes for over\nan hour. My truck-mate is tired of my\nsinging. He\nsuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn\nhave written\nother good songs besides \"You're Going\nto Miss Me When\nI'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" and that\nmaybe listening to\nonly those two songs, ten times each\nwas a bit\nexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I\ncould just let the\nCD play on its own. I tell him to\nfuck off and\nrestart \"Neon Moon.\"\n8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My\ntruckmate,\nagainst my loud and profane\nprotestations, parks on\nthe top floor of a nearby parking\ngarage. I tell him\nhe's an idiot. I tell him we will never\nget out. I\ntell him we may as well pitch a\nfucking tent here. He\nignores me. I think he's still pissed\nabout the\nBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon\nMoon\" loudly.\n8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers\nstuffed in\nmy pants. We're going to kick the\nshit out of\nArizona.\n9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona\n29. I am\npleased. I go to the bathroom to pee\nfor the 67th\ntime today. I giggle to myself because\nof the\nnew opportunity to do \"the bathroom\nBrice.\" There are\nno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am\ndisappointed.\nI tell myself (out loud) that I have a\n\"Niiiiiice\ncock.\" No one is amused but me.\n9:41 I walk to the bathroom while\ndrinking Bud Light\nout of a can. Needless to say, they do\nnot sell beer\nat the Erwin Center, much less Bud\nLight out of a can.\nI am stopped by an usher: \"Where did\nyou get\nthat, sir?\" I tell him (no shit):\n\"Oh, the\ncheerleaders were throwing them up with\nthose little\nplastic footballs. Would you mind\nthrowing this away\nfor me?\" I take the last swig and hand\nit to him. He\nis confused. I pretend I'm going to the\nbathroom, but\nI run away giggling instead. I duck\ninto some\nentrance to avoid the usher, who is now\npursuing me.\nI sneak into a large group of people\nand sit down.\nThe\nusher walks by harmlessly. I am\ngiggling like a little\ngirl. I crack open another can of Bud\nLight.\n9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid\nthe usher, I\nhave lost my bearings. I have no ticket\nstub. I\ncannot find my seats. Texas is losing.\n10:09 Texas is being screwed by the\nrefs. I am\nenraged. I have cleared out the seats\naround me\nbecause I keep removing my hat and\nbeating the\nsurrounding chairs with it. A concerned\nfan asks if\nI'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it\nso seriously.\nI tell him to fuck off.\n10:15 After the fourth consecutive\n\"worst fucking\ncall I have EVER seen,\" I attempt to\nremove my hat\nagain to begin beating inanimate\nobjects. However, on\nthis occasion I miscalculate and I\nthumbnail myself in\nmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter\ninch gash over\nmy eye. I am now bleeding into my left\neye and all\nover my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to\nmyself, \"I'm\ntaking this a bit seriously.\"\n10:22 I am standing in the bathroom\npeeing. I'm so\ndrunk I am swaying and grunting. I have\na bloody\nnapkin pressed on my left eye. My pants\nare bloody.\nI have my (formerly) white shirt\nwrapped around my\nwaist. I look like I should be in an\nepisode of Cops.\n10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody\nwhite shirt\nback on my body and make my way for the\nexits. I am\nstopped every 20 seconds by a good\nsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me\nwhy I am\ncovered in blood, but I merely grunt\nincoherently and\nkeep moving.\n10:59 With my one good eye, I have\nlocated the\nparking garage. I walk up six flights\nof stairs,\npromise that when I see my friend I\nwill punch him\nin the face for making me walk up six\nflights of\nstairs, find the truck, and collapse in\na heap in the\nbed of the truck. I look around and\nnotice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around\nthe garage, six\nwhole flights, and no one is moving. I\ntake a nap.\n11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my\nfriend in the\ndriver's seat. I lift my head to look\nout the bed of\nthe truck and notice that traffic is\nlined up all the\nway around the garage, six whole\nflights, and no one\nis\nmoving. I am too tired to punch my\nfriend. I call my\nfriend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n11:31 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:38 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:47 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:58 I am jostled. The truck is\nmoving. I lift my\nhead to look out the bed of the truck\nand notice that\ntraffic is beginning to move on the\nsecond floor. I\njump out of the truck, walk to the edge\nof the parking\nfacility, and pee off the sixth floor\nonto the street\nbelow. My friend looks at me like I\njust anally\nviolated his minor sister. I turn\naround and pee\non the front of his truck while singing\nthe lyrics\nto \"Neon Moon.\"\n12:11 We are moving. We are out of\nbeer. I jump\nfrom the truck and go from vehicle to\nvehicle until\nsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.\nI return to\nmy vehicle.\n12:26 We have emerged from the parking\nfacility. We\nmake our way to my apartment and find\nEd sitting on\nthe couch with a freshly opened bottle\nof Glenlivet on\nthe coffee table in front of him. We\nare all going to\ndie tonight.\n12:59 We have finished three-quarters\nof the bottle\nof Glenlivet. We decide it would be a\nwonderful idea\nto go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has\nto pee. He\nwalks down the hall to our apartment\nand directly into\nthe full length mirror at the end of\nthe hall,\nsmashing it into hundreds of pieces. We\ngiggle\nuncontrollably and leave for\nPollyEsther's.\n1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs\nuncontrollably\nat our efforts to enter his club.\n\"Fellas,\" he says\nin between his fits of spastic\nlaughter, \"I've been\nworking this door for almost a year.\nI've been\nworking\ndoors in this town for almost 5 years.\nAnd I can\nhonestly say that I ain't never seen\nthree drunker\nmother fuckers than you three.\nSorry, can't let you\nin.\" We attempt to reason with him. He\nlaughs\nharder.\n1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We\ntake two\nsteps in the door and hear \"Last call\nfor alcohol!\" I\nturn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat\nwasn't that\nfuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that\nat the\nAwamo...the awaom...the\nalab...fuck it, that stadium\nwe\nwas at today...\" We order 6 shots of\ntequila and\nthree beers.\n2:15 Back on the street. We need food.\nWe hail a\ncab to take us the two and one half\nblocks to Katz's.\nThe cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10\nand tell him\nto keep it.\n2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give\nthe hostess\n$50. We are seated immediately.\n2:25 We order two orders of fried\npickles, a Cobb\nsalad, a bowl of soup, two orders of\nBlueberry\nblintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a\nhamburger, two\ncheese stuffed potatoes, an order of\nfries, and an\norder of onion rings.\n2:39 The food arrives. We are all\nasleep with our\nheads on the table. The waiter wakes us\nup. We eat\nevery fucking bit of our food. Most\nof the restaurant\npatrons around us are disgusted. We\ndon't give a\nshit.\nThe tab is $112 with tip.\n2:46 I'm sleepy.\n9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.\nShe is the\nbartender at Katz's.

Not\na single cloud in the sky. About 70\ndegrees.\n11:55 I decide that we're going to kick\nthe shit out\nof Nebraska.\n11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to\ngo fuck\nhimself.\n12:15 The UT band walks by on the way\nto the\nAlamodome. We're on the second floor of\na two-story\nparking garage on the corner (a couple\nhundred of us).\nWe're hooting and hollering like\nwildmen. The band\ndoubles back to the street right below\nus and\nserenades us with Texas Fight and The\nEyes of Texas.\nAWESOME MOMENT.\n12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,\n50-100 grown\nmen are bumping chests with one\nanother, each and\nevery one of them now secure and\ncertain of the fact\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska.\n1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the\nway to the\nAlamodome. Again, we hoot and holler\nlike wildmen.\nAgain, the band doubles back and stops\nright below us\nto serenade us, this time, however,\nwith the Nebraska\nfight songs. Although somewhat\nimpressed by their\nspirit and verve, we remain convinced\nthat we are\ngoing to kick the shit out of\nNebraska.\n1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,\nsomehow\nmanaging to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11\ncans of beer\ninto my pants.\n1:47 I am in line surrounded by\nNebraska fans. They\nare taunting me. I am taunting back,\nstill certain\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska. I\ndecide to challenge a particularly\nvocal Nebraska fan\nto play what I now call and will\nforever be remembered\nas \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop\nout for a\ndollar? The rules are similar. I tell\nthis Nebraska\njackass that if he's so confident in\nhis team, he\nshould \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT\nNOW and make\nplane reservations to Phoenix for the\nFiesta Bowl.\nAnd then I spoke these memorable words:\n\"And not\nthose\ndamn refundable tickets, either! You\nrequest those\nnon-refundable, non-transferrable\nsons-of-bitches!\"\nHe backs down. He is unworthy. I call\nSouthwest\nAirlines and buy two tickets to\nPhoenix,\nnon-refundable\nand non-transferrable. Price: $712. He\nis humbled.\nHe lowers his head in shame. I raise my\ncell phone in\ntriumph to the cheers of hundreds of\nTexas fans. I am\nKING and these are my subjects. I\ndistribute the 11\nbeers in my pants to the cheering\nmasses. I RULE the\npre-game kingdom.\n2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,\nI open the\nTraveler and pour my first stiffy.\n2:45 I notice something troubling:\nNebraska is big.\nNebraska is fast. Nebraska is very\npissed off at\nTexas.\n3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.\n9 yards\ntotal offense for Texas. Zero first\ndowns for Texas.\nI'm still talking shit. I pour\nanother stiffy from\nthe Traveler.\n3:36 Four minutes to go in the first\nhalf: the\nTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy my\nfirst $5 beer\nfrom the Alamodome merchants. While I\nam standing in\nline, a center snap nearly decapitates\nMajor\nApplewhite\nand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.\n3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas\n0.

As I have\nindicated before, I believe Barry is a valuable asset but may need some more\nmanaging.\n\nTed Murphy@ECT\n02/09/2000 12:32 PM\nTo: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard\nCausey/Corp/Enron@ENRON\n\nSubject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London\n\nFernley,\nOn January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage\nwho recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for\ndoing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.\nSubsequently, Richard was \"moved\" from his position and Barry promoted.   If\nthat is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your\ncredibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back\noffice message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London\nby virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely\nmistaken.\nOn February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John\nSorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily\ncompleting the Audit tasks from London.\nI am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed\nmy \"advice\" and you need to do what you need to do.\nIf the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out\nof.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a\nresponsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to\nsurface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will\nbe supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money\ntrading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere.\nNeed I go on.\n\nLet us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose.\nTed\n\nFernley Dyson\n02/09/2000 04:56 AM\nTo: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard\nCausey/Corp/Enron@ENRON\nSubject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London\n\nTed,\n\nWe have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on\nspecific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and\nprior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and\nthe people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has\nchanged since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality\nrisk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary\nrecruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).\n\nBarry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the\nGlobal Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I\nsuggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -\nhis energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his\nconsiderable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult\nto find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to\naddress the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this\nissue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any \"prosecutable\"\noffences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management\nstyle doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and\nobjective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)\nwith me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a\ndifferent story to tell on Helsinki.\n\nAs an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',\nalthough I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks\nback. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy\nto contribute staff to this too.\n\nRegards\n\nFernley\n\nTo: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rick Buy, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\nSubject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London\n\nFernley,\nAs we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I\nthink are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I\nwill say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER\n\"prosecutable\" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more\ncommunicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his\ntransformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in\ncharge of the office.  Probably more to the point,\nit continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team\nthat is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that\nhe is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from\nHouston has to be part of the \"World Tour\"  in Europe (Brent Price), that\nyour candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David\nPort or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve\nYoung.\n\nFurther for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry\nhas a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,\nand other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I\njust happen to be the most vocal.\nTed\n\nFernley Dyson\n02/08/2000 04:07 PM\nTo: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT,\nSally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Trading Support Operations - London\n\nRick,\n\nNot wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support\nfunction, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we\nalready have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.\n\nThe issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more\npermanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry\nunderstands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we\nwould give him/her the job.\n\nI have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the\nteam that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant\nvalue by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.\nHowever, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,\nwhilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I\ncan see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.\n\nI suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted\nwithin Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in\nLondon) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy\nto replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will\nbe monitoring the situation very closely.\n\nRegards\n\nFernley."}], "summary": "Ted expresses his concerns about Barry's credibility and the dependence on him in the London operations team.

The basic use of the product is to assist mid and\nback office personnel with the completion of transaction details such as\nconfirmations, nominations and invoice reconciliations.\n\nAt the current time, the project is moving forward with four or five modules,\neach focused on a different aspect of mid and/or back office operations.  The\nmodule of primary concern (from a \"legal buy-in\" standpoint) is a module\nentitled ConfirmLogic.\n\nThe basic idea behind this module is to enable counterparties to a commodity\ntransaction to complete the confirmation process electronically through an\nelectronic matching system - matching information obtained from both parties\nto the transaction.  If the information matches, the CommodityLogic concept\nis that no further action will be required by either party to confirm the\ntransaction.  If information is \"published\" to CommodityLogic by only one\nparty to a transaction (such that the automatic matching function is not\nactivated), the other party my manually within the electronic module match or\nconfirm the transaction information by clicking on the appropriate button\nwithin the module, thereby confirming the transaction information and\nalleviating the need for any further confirmation action between the parties.\n\nThis system will present the opportunity to move away from written\nconfirmations and enable both parties to a transaction to accomplish the same\nmanner of confirmation electronically.  Whether or not this will be an\nacceptable legal method of confirming transactions within the Enron\nenvironment is the key question I have been asked to address with each of you\nrelative to your specific trading areas.  Accordingly, I am going to be\nsetting up a meeting later this week to discuss the project in a bit more\ndetail and to canvass the general opinions/questions/concerns each of you may\nhave.

There is an industry hub meeting next week - with limited attendance.  While continuing to promote the neutrality of the CL hub, Tom would also like to move this industry issue forward by possibly promoting the sale of interests in the CL hub.  I asked whether or not the hub can be separated from the base CL product (e.g., the general infrastructure and individual modules) and Tom responded that it is quite possible to separate the hub (and its support mechanisms - including the data base information) from the CL product.  I suggested that we may want to consider separating the hub from the product (by formation of a different legal entity), but would imagine that we would need tax and other approvals.\n\nTom would like assistance in the following areas:\n\n1.  General overview of the antitrust arena he would be dealing in.  I provided this consistent with my current understanding of antitrust matters in the e-commerce world (as confirmed by Ken Reisler at SC by previous discussions)\n\n2.  General overview of the vehicles that could be used to form the hub organization (e.g., profit vs. non-profit companies, LLC's vs. other corporate forms, alliance/joint ventures).  While I have some background in a lot of these type of organizations, I do not have any experience with non-profit entities.  Should I get someone at V&E or Sullivan & Cromwell to assist or is there anyone internal you could suggest?  V&E may be a better choice here only because of the probability that all potential owners are located in Houston.\n\n3.  General issues relating to confidentiality of discussions between potential hub owners.  While there is currently an NDA in place with a number of companies in relation to these discussions, Tom really sees only a handful being serious players.  Accordingly, it is possible Tom may want to spearhead conversations with only those few and possible move a project forward on a faster track.  The questions that have been raised are in relation to the manner in which these discussions should take place and how (if at all) they should be documented.  While I suggested that they should be under a secondary NDA and probably based upon some form of LOI or other intention memorandum, I believe we should get a clear indication of how to move forward so that we can ensure confidentiality, neutrality and avoidance of any future claims or concerns (e.g., antitrust concerns).  Is V&E the choice here also or should we talk to Sullivan personnel?\n\nTom will need some of this information for his meeting on Thursday.

Therefore all the transactions\nmanaged by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA.\n\nBecause of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the\ntransaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and\nlogoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility.

For example, the FX\ntransactions that are done by Trena McFarland in London are done on the\nbehalf of our Houston office, so Houston books the transaction, manages the\nrisk, and writes the Confirmation in the name of ENA.\n\nThis being the case, (i) can we apply the same logic on the internal FX\ntransactions that will be managed by both the US and UK traders and have the\ntransacting entity as ENA (ii) if we do does it gives us the necessary tax\nrelief, or (iii) should we stick the Metals structure where the transactions\nare offered by Enron North America, acting through it's agent, Enron Europe\nFinance and Trading Limited. While this may be an Internal Only Product Type\ntoday, what effect, if any, would the choice of trading entities have on our\nability to offer these Products externally.\n\nTechnology Issue:\n\nDavid - Stuart has explained to me that the US FX Desk now views these\ncurrency exchange products as financial products. This is contrary to\nprevious discussions where we felt that any currency exchange involving an\nIndex would be considered financial, while any 'strict exchange' would be\nconsidered a physical transaction. The change is based on conversations\nStuart has had with the Metals traders wherein they would like to see this\nexchange product as a financial product. If we accept this logic, (i) do I\nneed to create a Deal Type for 'Par Forward Swap' for the first FX Index\nProduct Type that we did as well as a 'Forward Swap' for these transactions,\nor is it acceptable to leave these both as swaps, and (ii) regardless of the\nDeal Type classification discussed in (i), I will need to create a new\nProduct Type for the 'strict exchange' - either as a physical or financial\nproduct. Additionally, if I set this up as Financial Product, I have the\nIndex attribute in the template to contend with, because there is no Index;\nand if I set this up as a Physical Product, I have the Location attribute to\ncontend with, because there is no Location. Naturally we can put something\ncheesy in to fill the gap since it's internal, but if we ever decide to go\nexternal we will need a new template - and from experience with the PJM Power\n(Weather Desk) Product Type, templates requires an 'and if' statement are\nhard to develop.\n\nDale"}], "summary": "The email thread discusses two main issues: tax and technology.

The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.\n\n2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40\n     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)\n\nSection 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.\n\n3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500\n\nI find no basis for this in the contract.\n\nUnder Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.

These reports were the result of a\nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff\n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of\ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed\nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller\n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no\nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically\nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly,\nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the\nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement\nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by\nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other\ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to\nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of\ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff\nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of\ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro\nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply\nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and\nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions\npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports\nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well\nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such\nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that\ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that\neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.\nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could\nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics\nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a\nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the\nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a\ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the\ncommodity and services.\n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,\ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission\nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such,\nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service\nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff\nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information\navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated\nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack\nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants\nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.\n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an\n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from\n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.\nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with\nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were\nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and\nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even\nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment,\n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The\ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are\nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an\ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission\naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and\nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and\ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,\nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs\nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market\ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully\nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse,\neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that\nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed\nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the\nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching\nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,\nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided\nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper\nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all\nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and\nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO\nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security\ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region\nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The\nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.\nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit\nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is\nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of\nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially\non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas\nof non-compliance.\n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,\nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow\ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information\ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under\nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a\nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption\nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could\nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the\nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also,\nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits\nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have\nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have\nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide\nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the\nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the\nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\"\nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory\nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.\nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,\nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has\nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the\neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs\nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due\nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,\ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and\nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the\ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development\nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and\nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted\nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the\nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have\nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to\nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform\ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant\nplants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.\n\nStaff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this\nsummer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than\nthe use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were\nradically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better\nprepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased\ngeneration capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.\n\nSE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to\nextensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)\n\nThe SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to\ndiscern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE\n(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence\nin the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be\njustified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence\ndiscourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes\nthat the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how\ntransmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns\nthat the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation\nfound numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In\naddition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff\nthinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.\nStaff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of\njurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access\ninformation.\n\nThe Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack\nof adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In\naddition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission\ncapacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to\ninterconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied\nSkygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the\nconstruction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.\nStaff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting\nself-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.\n\nATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a\nstandardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without\ndirection from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication\nare needed.\n\nThe SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises\nthe issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive\noperation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by\nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC\ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do\nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs\nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In\naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.\nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated\nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the\nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie,\ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same\ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision\nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a\n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission\nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law\nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of\ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong\nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In\naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists\na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the\ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park\npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the\ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including\nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange\ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to\nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an\nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not\ndisplayed in error.

These reports were the result of a\nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff\n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of\ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed\nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller\n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no\nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically\nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly,\nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the\nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement\nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by\nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other\ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to\nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of\ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff\nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of\ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro\nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply\nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and\nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions\npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports\nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well\nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such\nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that\ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that\neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.\nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could\nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics\nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a\nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the\nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a\ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the\ncommodity and services.\n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,\ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission\nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such,\nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service\nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff\nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information\navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated\nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack\nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants\nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.\n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an\n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from\n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.\nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with\nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were\nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and\nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even\nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment,\n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The\ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are\nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an\ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission\naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and\nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and\ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,\nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs\nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market\ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully\nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse,\neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that\nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed\nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the\nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching\nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,\nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided\nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper\nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all\nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and\nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO\nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security\ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region\nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The\nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.\nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit\nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is\nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of\nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially\non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas\nof non-compliance.\n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,\nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow\ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information\ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under\nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a\nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption\nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could\nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the\nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also,\nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits\nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have\nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have\nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide\nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the\nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the\nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\"\nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory\nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.\nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,\nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has\nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the\neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs\nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due\nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,\ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and\nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the\ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development\nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and\nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted\nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the\nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have\nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to\nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform\ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup.

Staff cites information provided by\nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC\ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do\nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs\nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In\naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.\nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated\nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the\nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie,\ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same\ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision\nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a\n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission\nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law\nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of\ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong\nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In\naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists\na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the\ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park\npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the\ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including\nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange\ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to\nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an\nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not\ndisplayed in error.  It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"  ((FRCC\nweb site report dated 9/8/00)).

These reports were the result of a\nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff\n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of\ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed\nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller\n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no\nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically\nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly,\nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the\nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement\nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by\nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other\ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to\nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of\ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff\nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of\ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro\nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply\nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and\nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions\npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports\nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well\nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such\nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that\ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that\neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.\nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could\nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics\nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a\nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the\nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a\ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the\ncommodity and services.\n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,\ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission\nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such,\nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service\nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff\nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information\navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated\nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack\nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants\nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.\n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an\n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from\n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.\nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with\nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were\nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and\nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even\nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment,\n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The\ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are\nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an\ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission\naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and\nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and\ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,\nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs\nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market\ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully\nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse,\neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that\nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed\nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the\nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching\nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,\nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided\nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper\nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all\nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and\nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO\nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security\ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region\nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The\nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.\nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit\nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is\nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of\nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially\non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas\nof non-compliance.\n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,\nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow\ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information\ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under\nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a\nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption\nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could\nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the\nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also,\nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits\nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have\nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have\nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide\nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the\nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the\nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\"\nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory\nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.\nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,\nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has\nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the\neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs\nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due\nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,\ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and\nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the\ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development\nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and\nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted\nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the\nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have\nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to\nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform\ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant\nplants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.\n\nStaff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this\nsummer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than\nthe use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were\nradically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better\nprepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased\ngeneration capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.\n\nSE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to\nextensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)\n\nThe SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to\ndiscern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE\n(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence\nin the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be\njustified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence\ndiscourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes\nthat the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how\ntransmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns\nthat the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation\nfound numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In\naddition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff\nthinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.\nStaff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of\njurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access\ninformation.\n\nThe Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack\nof adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In\naddition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission\ncapacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to\ninterconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied\nSkygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the\nconstruction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.\nStaff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting\nself-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.\n\nATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a\nstandardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without\ndirection from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication\nare needed.\n\nThe SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises\nthe issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive\noperation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by\nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC\ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do\nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs\nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In\naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.\nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated\nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the\nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie,\ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same\ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision\nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a\n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission\nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law\nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of\ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong\nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In\naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists\na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the\ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park\npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the\ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including\nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange\ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to\nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an\nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not\ndisplayed in error.  It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"  ((FRCC\nweb site report dated 9/8/00)).

Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an\ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission\naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and\nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and\ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,\nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs\nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market\ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully\nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse,\neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that\nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed\nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the\nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching\nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,\nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided\nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper\nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all\nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and\nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO\nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security\ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region\nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The\nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.\nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit\nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is\nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of\nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially\non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas\nof non-compliance.\n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,\nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow\ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information\ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under\nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a\nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption\nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could\nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the\nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also,\nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits\nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have\nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have\nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide\nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the\nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the\nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\"\nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory\nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.\nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,\nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has\nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the\neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs\nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due\nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,\ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and\nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the\ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development\nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and\nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted\nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the\nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have\nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to\nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform\ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant\nplants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.\n\nStaff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this\nsummer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than\nthe use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were\nradically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better\nprepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased\ngeneration capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.\n\nSE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to\nextensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)\n\nThe SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to\ndiscern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE\n(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence\nin the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be\njustified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence\ndiscourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes\nthat the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how\ntransmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns\nthat the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation\nfound numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In\naddition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff\nthinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.\nStaff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of\njurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access\ninformation.\n\nThe Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack\nof adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In\naddition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission\ncapacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to\ninterconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied\nSkygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the\nconstruction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.\nStaff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting\nself-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.\n\nATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a\nstandardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without\ndirection from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication\nare needed.\n\nThe SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises\nthe issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive\noperation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by\nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC\ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do\nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs\nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In\naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.\nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated\nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the\nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie,\ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same\ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision\nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a\n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission\nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law\nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of\ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong\nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In\naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists\na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the\ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park\npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the\ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including\nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange\ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to\nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an\nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not\ndisplayed in error.  It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"  ((FRCC\nweb site report dated 9/8/00)).

These reports were the result of a\nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff\n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of\ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed\nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller\n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no\nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically\nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly,\nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the\nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement\nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by\nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other\ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to\nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of\ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff\nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of\ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro\nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply\nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and\nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions\npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports\nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well\nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such\nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that\ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that\neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.\nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could\nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics\nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a\nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the\nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a\ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the\ncommodity and services.\n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,\ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission\nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such,\nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service\nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff\nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information\navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated\nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack\nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants\nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.\n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an\n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from\n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.\nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with\nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were\nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and\nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even\nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment,\n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The\ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are\nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.

In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.

Thanks.\n\nPlease note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful\ninformation that can be used at the state PUC level, including information on\nthe increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute\nto lack of price caps following the summer 1998 price spikes; better\npreparation for summer 2000 through the use of forward contracts and\ntransmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from\nparticular markets.\n\nOn 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power\nMarkets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a\nCommission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff\n(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of\ninformation for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed\nmany of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller\n(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no\nobligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically\nlooks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly,\nStaff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the\nSoutheast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement\nfor several years:\n\nReduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by\nrequiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other\ntransmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to\nfavor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of\ninterconnection requests.\n\nWhile the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff\nto conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of\ncomplaints.\n\nThe Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro\nforma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply\nrelying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and\nprocedures.\n\nRequire TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions\npertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports\nand exports.\n\nRTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well\nas standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such\nstandardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" -- that\ncontrol area still control generation -- the Commission could require that\neach RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.\nRegardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could\nstandardize ATC and TTC methodology.\n\nStaff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics\nsimilar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a\nreaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the\nregulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a\ntraditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the\ncommodity and services.\n\nDETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,\ntransmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):\n\nMidwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission\nProviders (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.  \"As such,\nthey have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service\nto third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"  Staff\nreceived numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information\navailable from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated\nincidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack\nof confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants\nto rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.\n\nTLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an\n\"enormous\" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from\n1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.\nEven though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with\nvirtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were\nhighly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and\nanother 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even\nthough the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment,\n78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The\ntotal amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are\nnot posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose\nprocedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission\nhas required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open\nAccess Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to\nenforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission\nhas generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,\nincluding the propriety of TLRs.\n\nTLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market\nbecause load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an\ninefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In\naddition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased\nloading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one\ncontrol area per RTO.\n\nStaff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for\nprice caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe\nthat the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction\nincreased in the Midwest.\n\nMarket participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information\nin order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for\nservice.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission\naccess, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and\nprotocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and\ndiscriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,\nsuch coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs\nwere called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market\ninefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully\nanalyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse,\neschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that\nbecause the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed\nincentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the\nIOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching\nthe Rules for Fun and Profit.\")\n\nStaff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,\nparticularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided\nto Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper\nimplementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.\n\nThe currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all\nthree retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and\nnative load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO\nexercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security\ncoordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region\nof 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The\nresult is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.\nStaff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit\nthis summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is\nweighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of\nliquidity.\n\nStaff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially\non the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas\nof non-compliance.\n\nInformation transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,\nwith equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow\ninput data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information\ntransparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under\nRTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  \"As a\nconsequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption\nand have all transactions under the same tariff.\"  ***  The Commission could\nbenefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the\nTPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.\n\nInterconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also,\nStaff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits\nor failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have\nthe RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have\nagainst IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide\nvariety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the\nregion.\n\nNetwork service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the\nEntergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on \"passively\"\nreceiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory\nbehavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.\nWhile Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,\nthere is evidence of discriminatory instances.\n\nSoutheast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has\nlargely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the\neconomic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs\nhave dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due\nto the inherent flexibility of the current rules.\n\nStaff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,\ntransmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and\nmanipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the\ntransmission system and use many TLRs.\n\nThere is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development\nof markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and\nthere is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.\n\nTVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted\nas a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the\nSE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have\nreported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to\nperform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform\ninterconnection studies.\n\nIn addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant\nplants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.\n\nStaff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this\nsummer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than\nthe use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were\nradically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better\nprepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased\ngeneration capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.\n\nSE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to\nextensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)\n\nThe SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to\ndiscern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE\n(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence\nin the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be\njustified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence\ndiscourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes\nthat the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how\ntransmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns\nthat the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation\nfound numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In\naddition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff\nthinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.\nStaff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of\njurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access\ninformation.\n\nThe Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack\nof adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In\naddition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission\ncapacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to\ninterconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied\nSkygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the\nconstruction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.\nStaff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting\nself-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.\n\nATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a\nstandardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without\ndirection from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication\nare needed.\n\nThe SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises\nthe issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive\noperation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by\nCharles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC\ncriteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do\nnot generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs\nmust have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In\naddition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.\nHowever, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.\n\n*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated\nweighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the\nformation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie,\ntreating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same\ntariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision\nof transparent and standardized information.\n\nFinally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a\n\"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission\nbottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law\nand lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of\ndeep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong\nincentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In\naddition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists\na number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the\ntag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park\npower.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the\ndevelopment of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.\n\nA Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including\nconfidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange\ninformation for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to\nFPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an\nestablished procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not\ndisplayed in error.  It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"  ((FRCC\nweb site report dated 9/8/00)).

I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?\n\nFYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.

On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent\nGoverning Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty\nreasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I\nthink we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that\nthe Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always\nbe 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more\nlikely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws\nregarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more\nequitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.\n\nBut aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about\nDSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the\nfall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are\nall preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to\nmarket; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC\nservices and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are\nmuch better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are\nbeing preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And\nas to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know\nwhat the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in\nagreement with our position.\n\nIn most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the\nresult of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of\nthe Enron physical rights model over the years).\n\nThere are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but\noverall, we stand to win on most of them.\n\nSo: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require\nthe CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate\nauthority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could\nbe up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into\npitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.

{"thread_id": "kaggle:1390", "source": "kaggle_email", "domain": "email", "title": "RSM v. El Paso", "messages": [{"mid": 0, "parent": null, "author": "Davis, Britt BDAVIS", "time": "2001-10-25T14:30:46Z", "lang": null, "text": "I just participated in a joint defense conference call with in-house and outside counsel in this matter.  I was not given notice of the call until a moment or two before it occurred.  We plan to have another such call next Thursday, at the same time.  In a nutshell,\n\n\t1.  All the defendants want to retain our outside counsel (Lazaro Garza-Gongora) as their outside counsel.  I told them that I had no problem with that so long as, in the event of a conflict, which I did not anticipate, my clients got to keep him.  Of course, I am assuming that his fees and expenses would be apportioned among us.  No one seemed to have a problem with that, but I need to follow it up in writing.  I also anticipate a joint defense agreement.\n\n\t2. The answer date for Enron Corp. and Intratex (Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has not to our knowledge been served) is Monday, November 5.  Although Lazaro hasn't called me back yet about his review of the Court's file, which he told me last week he would do, the attorneys on the conference call reportedly represented all the named defendants, and no one had an earlier answer date.\n\n\t3. I was asked to ask Lazaro to ask for an extension of time on behalf of all the defendants until and including December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I have a call in to Lazaro to discuss that approach.  Query whether we want to agree to respond at the same time on behalf of EGM if EGM hasn't been served.\n\n\t4.  During the conference call, a number of factual, legal and strategy issues were discussed.  Foremost among them was getting this case dismissed before merits discovery commenced.  This would obviously be a home run in this case; also, it would prevent Grynberg from getting his hands on documents that he would then pretend to have known about all along in his qui tam action, bolstering his original source argument.  Also discussed was the following:\n\n\ta.  No one could articulate a good removal theory, although there was much discussion.  Unlike the Quinque case, there is no offshore gas involved here.  Further, there was considerable concern that if the case was removed, Grynberg would try to get it MDL'd, so that the MDL court would hear the remand argument.  There was a concern about that, given the MDL Court's view of Northern's removal in the Quinque case.\n\n\tb.  Motions for change of venue.  One basis might be that because, among other things, of the plaintiffs' anticipated argument that they were representing the schoolchildren of Zapata County, defendants may not be able to get a fair trial in Zapata County.\n\n\tc.  A plea to the jurisdiction, challenging the standing of RSM to make this claim.  There is a fundamental ambiguity in the pleadings, which is that the suit purports to be both one for the collection of delinquent ad valorem taxes, and one for damages based on fraud, etc.\n\n\td.  Why the petition mentions \"Other counties\".  I raised the possibility of communitized or unitized leases with wells in adjacent counties; another thought was that this was an invitation to other county school boards to intervene.  I also mentioned that I did not interpret the petition to include the State of Texas as a party, but that it was not entirely clear.  Others agreed about the poor draftsmanship, but the concensus is that the State of Texas (which apparently cannot collect ad valorem taxes anyway) is not a party or being represented as such by RSM.\n\n\te.  I raised the possibility of a motion to abate, based on the pending Quinque case, which purports to be a class action on behalf of, among others, taxing authorities.  The concensus was that this was not a good idea, primarily because it would force us to concede that plaintiffs were in fact adequately represented in Quinque, where they are not parties, and where we are vigorously contesting class certification.\n\n\tf. An argument based on lack of indispensable parties, to include all the actual Zapata County taxpayers who haven't paid enough.\n\n\tI will continue to keep you advised.

Having read it, I think I recall having seen it years ago when it was distributed in the Grynberg suit by Mike Noone of the Beatty Law Firm.  Long and short, Jack Grynberg signed this contract as chairman and CEO of RSM with the County of Zapata (the only other party; the Zapata Independent School District is not named in the contract, although it is named in the lawsuit) in 1997.\n\n\tIt is basically a retainer agreement that purports to give RSM the right to collect unpaid ad valorem taxes on behalf of the County of Zapata, Texas (again, not mentioning that it would be on behalf of the Zapata Independent School District).  Grynberg agrees to front the litigation costs and gets 40% of any taxes and fees recovered.  I see little difference between this agreement and what a plaintiff's law firm would have required.\n\n\tThis strikes me as a blatant attempt to create by contract what does not exist by statute:  a Texas qui tam action (you may recall that a Texas qui tam bill even broader than the federal act was pending in the Legislature last year, but was not passed).  I also wonder whether this amounts to the unauthorized practice of law, barratry, etc.\n\n\tGiven that the contract was signed in 1997 and that recovery in the Zapata County suit would probably be very small compared to the nation-wide qui tam action even in a worst-case situation for the defendants, the view is that Grynberg may have filed this primarily because both his nationwide qui tam action and the Quinque action stalled and Grynberg needs merits discovery as quickly as possible to bolster his original source position.\n\n\tI will keep you advised.\n\n\tBritt"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Davis, Britt BDAVIS", "time": "2001-10-29T15:48:24Z", "lang": null, "text": "=09I have not heard back from Lazaro as to our request for an extension of =\ntime.

I have never seen a \"supplemental\" plea=\nding that dropped class action allegations and defendants, and added plaint=\niffs.  The first supplemental petition is more correctly titled an amended =\npetition.  Perhaps the plaintiff's attorney had a reason for not calling at=\ntention to the radical change in the nature of a lawsuit.\n\n=092.  On March 21, 2000, the Court issued an order on plaintiff's verified=\n motion to retain case.  The order was based on a motion by plaintiff for i=\ntself and all other similarly situated counties, alleging that the same gro=\nup of defendants had been sued in Quinque and removed the case.  \"Judicial =\neconomy will result in the present action by waiting for a ruling in the Ka=\nnsas litigation, thus avoiding the same procedural motions in this case.\"  =\nPlaintiff moved for and was granted abatement of the case for 6 months unti=\nl September 21, 2000 or until 30 days after a ruling on the motion for rema=\nnd in the Kansas litigation, whichever comes first. =20\n =20\n=093.  On March 12, 2001 (almost a year later than item #2), one of plainti=\nff's counsel, the law firm of Farnsworth and Von Berg, L.L.P., here in Hous=\nton, moved to withdraw as counsel for non-payment of fees by Jack Grynberg.=\n  The motion notes as follows:  \"In November 1999, following filing of this=\n lawsuit, Movants and Jack Grynberg and RSM Corporation, as representative =\nof Zapata County Independent School District, severed their attorney/client=\n relationship because Jack Grynberg failed to pay attorney fees as per thei=\nr contractual agreement.\"  There is nothing in the file reflecting even a p=\nroposed order, much less a hearing on the motion.\n\n=094.

I believe that I previously e-mailed to you drafts prepared by F&J for El Paso and circulated to the group.  Each of the defendant groups is planning to prepare and file its own pleas to the jurisdiction, answers, and affirmative defenses.  I will prepare and circulate drafts tailored to the only two Enron defendants yet served, Enron Corp. and Intratex.  By copy of this, I am asking Becky Stephens to again confirm that we have no evidence that Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has been served.\n\n\tA strategy issue under consideration is whether to file motions to transfer venue for the holding companies, like Enron Corp. So far, based on the due diligence I have done to date, it does not appear that Enron Corp. ever owned or operated any facilities in Zapata County (much less measured gas there) or owned any gas reserves or gas in storage, which should be the relevant considerations. I was asked by the joint defense group to do some legal research on this issue, given that Grynberg has made \"in concert\" allegations against all the defendants, and that we expect Grynberg to rely on venue being good against EOG Resources and trying to keep the remaining defendants (those who are not measurers and therefor independently subject to venue) based on section 15.005 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which allows venue against co-defendants in situations like this where the allegations concern the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurences.\n\n\tIn short, the caselaw I have seen causes me a concern we may open ourselves up to merits discovery on the \"in concert\" allegations by filing a motion to transfer venue on behalf of the holdling companies.  I have already mentioned that to other defense counsel and expect that issue to be discussed at our telephone conference this afternoon.\n\n\tAlso, please let me know whether you want me to send any of the proposed pleadings to Barrett Reasoner or Charlie Tetrault, or to discuss our strategy Barrett or Charlie, to coordinate with strategy in the Grynberg and Quinque cases.\n\n\tParenthetically, our due diligence investigation of Intratex has revealed an accounting document which appears to list an Intratex facility in Zapata County.  This makes no sense and is very puzzling to those we have interviewed at Enron about it.  We will be meeting later this week with AEP employees who will hopefully be able to shed some light on this.\n\n\tI will keep you advised.\n\n\tBritt"}, {"mid": 7, "parent": null, "author": "Davis, Britt BDAVIS", "time": "2001-11-27T13:29:04Z", "lang": null, "text": "=09This will update you on the matters discussed during the joint defense c=\nonference call held this afternoon:\n\n=091.  One defendant group has approached the plaintiff's lead attorney reg=\narding a non-suit prior to the December 5 deadline for moving, answering or=\n otherwise pleading, but has heard nothing.  Others intend to do so before =\nDecember 5 as well.  I am trying to quickly wrap up my due diligence on Int=\nratex, and once that is done, plan to approach the plaintiffs for a non-sui=\nt of at least Enron Corp. and, depending on the results of the due diligenc=\ne, on Intratex as well.  EGM has still not been served to our knowledge.\n\n=092.  After discussion, counsel for the defendant holding companies have a=\ngreed to file on December 5 bare-bones motions to transfer venue to Harris =\nCounty, with the intention of waiving them if plaintiffs appear disposed to=\n push back on them.  This is because of the problem I mentioned in my earli=\ner e-mail today with a venue challenge opening the defendants up to discove=\nry on the merits of the \"in concert\" allegations.  I will be drafting a pro=\nposed motion to transfer venue for at least Enron Corp., and will circulate=\n it among the defendants for them to use as a guide.  I may also draft a mo=\ntion to sever (one is arguably necessary for a motion to transfer venue to =\nbe effective in a case like this), although it too would be bare-bones.  On=\ne of the three required grounds for a motion to sever is that the severed a=\nnd the remaining causes must not be so intertwined as to involve the same f=\nacts and issues.  Accordingly, I see pursuing a motion to sever on behalf o=\nf Enron Corp. to be highly problematic as well.   =20\n\n=093.   All agreed to join in a motion to require Grynberg to show authorit=\ny.  I have previously e-mailed you a draft prepared by F&J.  We see no down=\nside to filing it and considerable upside, such as using it at least to blo=\nck discovery by Grynberg until it is resolved.  Please let me know if I hav=\ne your authority to sign the motion.  It will be filed no earlier than Dece=\nmber 6, and expressly subject to earlier-filed motions to transfer venue.\n\n=094.  I will be working on a plea to the jurisdiction, answer, and affirma=\ntive defenses to file on behalf of Enron Corp and Intratex, subject to any =\nmotion to transfer venue, and will circulate them to you for your review an=\nd approval.  During the conference call, I raised the issue of adding a spe=\ncial exception to the effect that the petition fails to state a claim, whic=\nh is the proper procedural vehicle for what is essentially a Rule 12(b)(6) =\nmotion under the Texas Rules.  One attorney expressed concern that filing a=\n special exception could be viewed as somehow prejudicing a motion to trans=\nfer venue.  As you can clearly raise a special exception later, we decided =\nnot to include a special exception in the pleadings we were filing on Decem=\nber 5.  We can always file it later.\n\n=095.   On Friday, November 30, at 1:30 p.m ., there will be another joint =\ndefense conference call.  The discussion will be centered around whether La=\nzaro was able to find any retainer agreement between the Zapata County Inde=\npendent School District and RSM (we only have a contract between Zapata Cou=\nnty and RSM).

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.\nHere is a summary of the paper:\n        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.\n        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.\n        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.\n        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:\nMaintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.\nEnsure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.\nEncourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).\nCreate honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.\nEncourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.\nCreate efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.\nMonitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).\n\n        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.\n        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.\n        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.\n        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.\nHere is a summary of the paper:\n        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.\n        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.\n        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.\n        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:\nMaintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.\nEnsure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.\nEncourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).\nCreate honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.\nEncourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.\nCreate efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.\nMonitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).\n\n        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.\n        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.\n        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.\n        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.\nEric"}], "summary": "The email thread consists of an email from Samantha Slater forwarding a report on lessons from the California electricity crisis to multiple recipients.

The decision is being handed down\napproximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan\nSumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:\n(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to\ndo the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning\nthe Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the\nindividual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a\ndecision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not\nwriting the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the\nruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently\nlikelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are\nunlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we\nbelieve we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up\nvalue by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not\nmake an offer of settlement.\n\nWe expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement\nwill be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each\nof you is contacted as soon as possible with the result."}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Richard B Sanders", "time": "2001-04-04T07:39:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "fyi\n----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 04/04/2001 02:38 PM -----\n\n\tMary Nell Browning\n\t04/04/2001 01:59 PM\n\n\t\t To: James Derrick/Enron@EnronXGate, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, John\nSherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Evans/Legal/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley\nDyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Chivers/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Frevert/Enron@EnronXGate,\nGreg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jackie\nGentle/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Claire Wright/LON/ECT@ECT,\nRaj N Patel - Tax/LON/ECT@ECT, Rex Rogers/Enron@EnronXGate\n\t\t cc: Richard Harper/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Turner/LON/ECT@ECT, Peter\nCrilly/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: CATS litigation\n\nDisappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS\nlitigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties\napproximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final\nfigure at an estimated $155-160 million.

Furthermore, he says\nthat the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature\nof a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.\n\nAs far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that\nthe clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The\ncontract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it\nis only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the\nTransportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price\nreduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This\nstatement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the\nopinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties\nhave an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.\n\nEqually disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our\nsubmission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the\nrestitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon\nwhich the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point\nat the commencement of the hearing.

The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.\nSent:\tMonday, October 01, 2001 5:03 PM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit\n\nWe need to discuss the economics of this on our book (assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers).\n\nJim\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff\nSent:\tMonday, October 01, 2001 3:56 PM\nTo:\tKean, Steven J.; Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mara, Susan; Kaufman, Paul; Mellencamp, Lisa; Curry, Wanda; Tribolet, Michael\nSubject:\tMeeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit\n\nTalked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.\n\nSummary of our offer:\nEdison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.\nPayment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.\nIn return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.\nIn return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.\n\nFielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.

Nothing was agreed to, but I wanted to make certain you were aware of this meeting.  It is interesting that all of SCE's comments dealt with their under collection and the DWR costs.  I have not continued to monitor current tariff assumptions.  However, I do not believe estimates for the resolution of these issues are currently included.   As I understand things, it remains anybody's guess as to what will be required of direct access customers, much less how much of the under collection SCE will be allowed to recover.

(Most of the\nnotes could be included in a mark-up sent back to VEPCO; there is one marked\n\"Note to Enron\" that is intended to be deleted before we send this out.)\n\nThe Agreement, as might be expected, is very  one-sided and is written\nprimarily for their protection.  It is also very repetitive in places,\nalthough I did not attempt to eliminate the repetition on the theory that the\nfewer changes we propose the better and we can probably live with the\nrepetition.  There are several provisions or concepts I would like to suggest\nwe include from the form I had prepared a couple of weeks ago (which was\nbased on the EPSA model form, and was clearly more favorable to the\ngeneration owner than VEPCO's form.)  I have not yet included these changes,\nas I thought we should discuss them first and decide how best to proceed on\nthis draft.  Those provisions are as follows (section references are to the\ndraft I prepared):\n\n2.43.  Right to tell VEPCO to suspend or terminate work on interconnection\nfacilities.\n\n2.4.4  Requirement for Vepco to provide status reports on progress of\nconstruction of interconnection facilities.\n\n2.5.2 (maybe)  Agreement to start work on facilities before all studies\ncomplete, if generator owner willing to bear risk of extra costs.\n\n2.7.1 Undertaking by Vepco to use reasonable efforts to complete on schedule\n(actually, if 4.2.2 is used, this section probably should not be used.)\n\n3.11.3 (last sentence)  Vepco liable for costs for modifications to\ngenerator-owned interconnection facilities and the Facility if changes\nrequired because of changes to Vepco facilities (unless required by law).\n\n4.1 Vepco must inform generator owner if costs exceed estimate by more than\n10% and such increase is subject to generator owner's consent.\n\n4.2.2 Concept that Vepco must seek bids for the work and generator owner can\nchoose whether the work is done with best efforts undertaking to complete on\ntime, but no penalties/incentives or with firm completion date and\npenalties/incentives.\n\n4.3  Generator owner to provide letter of credit for cost of work or\nguarantee (as opposed to 50% paid in advance, as provided in Vepco's draft.\nBy the way, even if we agreed to pay 50% in advance, it should not be on\nsigning the agreement, but rather before they start the work.)\n\n4.8.1  Refund if Vepco receives money back.\n\n4.9.1  Language re tax gross up (in lieu of the last sentence in their\nSection 7.3.)\n\n5.1  Last sentence--add generator owner's schedules and output,etc. being\nconfidential.\n\nIn addition, there were a few things in the draft I wanted to point out, as\nfollows:\n\nIn Section 2.2.3 and elsewhere in the agreement, they reserve the right to\nmake a unilateral filing with FERC to amend the agreement.  The generator\nowner would have the right to protest the filing, but I want to check with\nour regulatory people as to whether they can waive this right, as I don't\nthink it's fair for them to unilaterally amend it.\n\nArticle 4.6 should be reviewed by technical folks.\n\nIn Section 10.2.1.3, they reserve the right to file the agreement with FERC\neven if the parties haven't agreed and executed it yet and they start service\nunder the agreement.  As noted above, it's putting your fate in FERC's hands.\n\nThe indemnity of Vepco's employees and waiver of the protection of worker's\ncomp laws in Section 10.5.1 (and the reciprocal in 10.5.2) seemed strange to\nme and I was wondering if you could run this past your risk management people.\n\nI look forward to discussing this with you further.\n\n - 1155119.doc"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Kay Mann", "time": "2000-09-12T03:46:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "fyi"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Kay Mann", "time": "2000-09-12T03:56:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Please add this name to the Virginia Power part of the list."}, {"mid": 3, "parent": null, "author": "Kay Mann", "time": "2000-09-12T04:10:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Ben,\n\nWe have a draft of the VEPCO \"standard\" interconnect, which has been\ninternally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.

I feel that our support could\neasily be the kiss of death to a particular proposal.  The bottom line is\nthat our proposal works with any allocation method.  We can support the one\nthat is accepted in the recommended decision or argue for another but I would\nhold off in this round.\nAgree\n\nWhile some of the additions to rate design section seem to be along the lines\nof what we put in the record, both in direct and on cross, I think the free\nrider, CBL stuff is new and could be stricken, and may just make our stuff\nseem more complicated.\nAgree\n\nI have similar concerns about the alternate interim proposal in this brief,\nseems like it  includes lots of facts we did not put in our testimony.\nWe did put the facts in in the response to data we filed with ALJ on monday.\nIf you are referring to ratios between on and off peak.\n\nPX credit based on market value -- the hearing examiner has no authority to\naddress this issue so why put it in?  In a case like this with such a short\ntime frame, decision makers who want to be diligent and read everything that\nis filed, will resent having to read stuff that is not germane to the issues\nat hand.

We are going to talk tomorrow=\n=20\nand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =\nwe=20\nhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\nmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=\n=20\nof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20\ntrouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=\n=20\nhelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20\nmark-up.\n\nFollowing are my points responsive to their revisions:\n\nPart 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=\n=20\npossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20\nexample, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=\n=20\nthis agreement would be in default).\n\n(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=\n=20\nto the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\n=20\nreason to remove it.\n\nPart 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=\n=20\nout exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=\ne=20\nnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\n=20\nagree we will put it in the agreement.\n\nPart 4 (f)  By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\nt=20\npayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\nt=20\n(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\n=20\nmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\nne=20\npayment).  This is not acceptable.\n\n(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\nNA.\n\nPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\nreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\nprovision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20\npossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\n=20\nhonored.\n\n(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\n=20\ncity.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\not=20\nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\n\n(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=\nt=20\nhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=\n=20\nas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\npractice.\n\n(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\no=20\nmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\n=20\nIBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=\n=20\ntrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\n=20\nwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=\n=20\nto restrict ourselves that way.\n\n(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=\n=20\nthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=\nt=20\nwholesale deletion is out of the question.\n\n(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=\n=20\nmaintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=\n=20\nwith which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=\n=20\nimportant to us.\n\n(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=\nt=20\nwent into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =\n=20\nWe disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=\nur=20\nrevision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=\nr=20\nhigh rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=\ns=20\nmore appropriate.\n\n(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20\nprotects us both.\n\n(n)  You know more about this than I.\n\nPart 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20\nindividually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=\nns=20\nare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=\n=20\nsignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=\n=20\nand we need to know now if they object to any of them.\n\nOther revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =\nI=20\nhope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=\ns=20\nany of these issues at greater length if you want.

We are going to talk tomorrow=\n=20\nand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =\nwe=20\nhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\nmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=\n=20\nof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20\ntrouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=\n=20\nhelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20\nmark-up.\n\nFollowing are my points responsive to their revisions:\n\nPart 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=\n=20\npossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20\nexample, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=\n=20\nthis agreement would be in default).\n\n(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=\n=20\nto the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\n=20\nreason to remove it.\n\nPart 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=\n=20\nout exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=\ne=20\nnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\n=20\nagree we will put it in the agreement.\n\nPart 4 (f)  By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\nt=20\npayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\nt=20\n(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\n=20\nmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\nne=20\npayment).  This is not acceptable.\n\n(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\nNA.\n\nPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\nreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\nprovision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20\npossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\n=20\nhonored.\n\n(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\n=20\ncity.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\not=20\nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\n\n(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=\nt=20\nhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=\n=20\nas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\npractice.\n\n(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\no=20\nmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\n=20\nIBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=\n=20\ntrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\n=20\nwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.

While =\nwe=20\nhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\nmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.

It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\n=20\nreason to remove it.\n\nPart 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=\n=20\nout exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=\ne=20\nnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\n=20\nagree we will put it in the agreement.\n\nPart 4 (f)  By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\nt=20\npayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\nt=20\n(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\n=20\nmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\nne=20\npayment).  This is not acceptable.\n\n(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\nNA.\n\nPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\nreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\nprovision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20\npossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\n=20\nhonored.\n\n(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\n=20\ncity.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\not=20\nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\n\n(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=\nt=20\nhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=\n=20\nas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\npractice.\n\n(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\no=20\nmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\n=20\nIBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=\n=20\ntrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\n=20\nwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=\n=20\nto restrict ourselves that way.\n\n(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=\n=20\nthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=\nt=20\nwholesale deletion is out of the question.\n\n(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=\n=20\nmaintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=\n=20\nwith which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=\n=20\nimportant to us.\n\n(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=\nt=20\nwent into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =\n=20\nWe disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=\nur=20\nrevision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=\nr=20\nhigh rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=\ns=20\nmore appropriate.\n\n(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20\nprotects us both.\n\n(n)  You know more about this than I.\n\nPart 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20\nindividually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=\nns=20\nare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=\n=20\nsignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=\n=20\nand we need to know now if they object to any of them.\n\nOther revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =\nI=20\nhope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.

We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=\n=20\nEvent of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20\nreleases a technical error.\n\n(c)  Agreed.\n\n(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.\n\n(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20\nbranch offices.

We are going to talk tomorrow=\n=20\nand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =\nwe=20\nhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\nmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=\n=20\nof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20\ntrouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=\n=20\nhelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20\nmark-up.\n\nFollowing are my points responsive to their revisions:\n\nPart 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=\n=20\npossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20\nexample, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=\n=20\nthis agreement would be in default).\n\n(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=\n=20\nto the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\n=20\nreason to remove it.\n\nPart 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=\n=20\nout exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=\ne=20\nnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\n=20\nagree we will put it in the agreement.\n\nPart 4 (f)  By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\nt=20\npayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\nt=20\n(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\n=20\nmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\nne=20\npayment).  This is not acceptable.\n\n(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\nNA.\n\nPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\nreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\nprovision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20\npossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\n=20\nhonored.\n\n(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\n=20\ncity.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\not=20\nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\n\n(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=\nt=20\nhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=\n=20\nas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\npractice.\n\n(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\no=20\nmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\n=20\nIBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=\n=20\ntrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\n=20\nwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=\n=20\nto restrict ourselves that way.\n\n(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.

Due to our system=20\nincapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=\nre=20\nTransactions in the same currency.\n\n(h) Agreed.\n\nPart 5\n\n(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=\n=20\ncontinue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=\n=20\nwhich does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=\n=20\nEvent of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20\nreleases a technical error.\n\n(c)  Agreed.\n\n(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.\n\n(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20\nbranch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=\n=20\nthis Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=\nrd=20\nthat in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=\ne=20\nobligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.\n\n(i)  Agreed to include this provision.\n\n(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=\ns=20\nwithout the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=\n=20\napproval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=\n=20\ncause an additional payment of tax or other cost.\n\n(k)  We will revert to you later.\n\n(m)  Agreed.\n\n(n)  Agreed to include this provision.\n\nPart 6\n\nWe still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20\nTransactions in the respective Confirmations.\"\n\nI look forward to receiving your input.

We are going to talk tomorrow=\n=20\nand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =\nwe=20\nhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\nmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=\n=20\nof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20\ntrouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=\n=20\nhelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20\nmark-up.\n\nFollowing are my points responsive to their revisions:\n\nPart 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=\n=20\npossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20\nexample, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=\n=20\nthis agreement would be in default).\n\n(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=\n=20\nto the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\n=20\nreason to remove it.\n\nPart 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=\n=20\nout exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=\ne=20\nnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\n=20\nagree we will put it in the agreement.\n\nPart 4 (f)  By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\nt=20\npayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\nt=20\n(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\n=20\nmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\nne=20\npayment).  This is not acceptable.\n\n(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\nNA.\n\nPart 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\nreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\nprovision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20\npossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\n=20\nhonored.\n\n(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\n=20\ncity.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\not=20\nimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\n\n(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=\nt=20\nhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=\n=20\nas high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\npractice.\n\n(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\no=20\nmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\n=20\nIBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=\n=20\ntrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\n=20\nwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=\n=20\nto restrict ourselves that way.\n\n(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=\n=20\nthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=\nt=20\nwholesale deletion is out of the question.\n\n(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=\n=20\nmaintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=\n=20\nwith which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=\n=20\nimportant to us.\n\n(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=\nt=20\nwent into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =\n=20\nWe disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=\nur=20\nrevision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=\nr=20\nhigh rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=\ns=20\nmore appropriate.\n\n(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20\nprotects us both.\n\n(n)  You know more about this than I.\n\nPart 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20\nindividually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=\nns=20\nare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=\n=20\nsignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=\n=20\nand we need to know now if they object to any of them.\n\nOther revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =\nI=20\nhope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=\ns=20\nany of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20\nIBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=\ne=20\nvolume and nature of their comments.\n\n=09John Viverito@ENRON\n=0909/05/2000 09:06 PM\n=09=09\n=09=09 To: Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT\n=09=09 cc: Jonathan.Whitehead@enron.com@ECT, Kevin Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, S=\nteven=20\nKleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\n=09=09 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT\n\nTom-\n\nAs far as the progress on the ISDA documentation, I am awaiting feedback fr=\nom=20\nboth legal and credit in Houston. =20\n\nCould you provide me with the details of the proposed transaction(s).

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).\n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account.\n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:\n\nTXU Energy Trading\nBP Energy Company\nReliant Energy Services, Inc.\nAquila Power Corporation\nMorgan Stanley capitral Group\nConstellation Power Source\nFPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.\nAmerican Electic Power Service Corporation\nMirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP\nCalpine Energy Servicces LP\nDynegy Marketing & Trade\nLCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority\n\nalong with a couple of incumbent utilities:\n\nSan Antonio City Public Service\nReliant HL&P\n\nIf you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.\nSent:\tWednesday, January 30, 2002 8:41 AM\nTo:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Day, Smith L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Portz, David\nCc:\tWill, Lloyd; Presto, Kevin M.; Bailey, Debra; Haedicke, Mark E.\nSubject:\tUBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs\n\nUBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.

This does not put them on 'hold' for a later\nswitch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply\nremain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they\nchoose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the\ncustomers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch\ntransaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,\nthe switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract\nupdating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter\nbetween you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if\nquestions.\n\nHave you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could\nanswer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the\ncreditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone\nASAP.

P.46\n\n4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a\ndelivery/receipt at Ferc.\n\n5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage\ncapacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current\nlevel 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current\nstorage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs\nproposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.\n52 &54.\n\n6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share\nof non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests.

P.66\n\n10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by\nbundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct\nimpact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore\ninterest. P. 75\n\n11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective\nthe adoption of the PD.

Bilas as requested. In view\nof the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the\ncurrent 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary\nof the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :\n\n1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt\npoint capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration\nhistorically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will\nbe successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits\nin the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any\nmisbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44\n\n2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized\nfirm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.\nP.45\n\n3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.\nThis is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set\nin this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between\nSoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the\ninterstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46\n\n4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a\ndelivery/receipt at Ferc.\n\n5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage\ncapacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current\nlevel 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current\nstorage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs\nproposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.\n52 &54.\n\n6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share\nof non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58\n\n7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore\ndefault balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using\nthis service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62\n\n8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a\nproposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I\nsee only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63\n\n9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures\nassociated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO\nimpact on TW. P.66\n\n10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by\nbundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct\nimpact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore\ninterest. P. 75\n\n11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective\nthe adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core\nITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on\nTW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an\nadditional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an\nestimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be\napprox. $ 44.4 Million.\n\n12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4\ncents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.\n\n13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.\nNo impact on TW. P.85-87\n\n14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP\nmarket rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO\nimpact on TW interest. P 88-100.\n\n15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to\nservices envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already\nstarted to \"implement\" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a\nbalancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the\nPD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.\n\nOn whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.\nThe SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with \"SoCal backbone\nfacilities\". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is\nrecognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a\npreference for capacity expansion.

Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Robe=\nrts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =\nestimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=\n30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, publis=\nhed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=\nge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =\nas a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 p=\nrice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges tha=\nt Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=\nements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by pub=\nlication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An en=\nergy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains=\n fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business=\n model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid =\ninsights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economi=\nes of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analy=\nsts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent tra=\nck record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed =\ncame crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve,=\n recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news=\n ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei=\nr prices at their most insane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long =\nrally   Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual re=\nvenue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ra=\nnked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr=\necipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability=\n measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=\nch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=\nxes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=\nuarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,=\n compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=\narlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =\nyear-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=\n-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=\nenue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs =\nto generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it m=\nakes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  T=\nhe energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can=\n continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply =\nby increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words=\n, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stil=\nl go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=\nd of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=\nage points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Gr=\nowing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so =\nhelped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the anal=\nyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. sti=\nll isn't traded in a market. \"Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=\nnvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years,\" says the analyst. And he beli=\neves the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also ben=\nefited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point o=\nn profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (n=\net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 19=\n99's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - n=\news ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). =\n Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For ex=\nample, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or=\n trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the =\ncompany's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange =\nCommission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron=\n's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities th=\nat have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities=\n that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The en=\nergy analyst comments: \"Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate.\" =\n The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has be=\nen a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f=\niber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second =\nquarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical c=\nable without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to be=\nat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather t=\nhan missing by 2 cents.

If you\nwant me to use a headline other than the first one, please send me an\ne-mail.  Again, I'll include a headline if it is done on Saturday or\n(even better) Sunday.  I won't use a Friday headline because I'd like\nthe news to be fresh.\n\nBoard members... please work on bios and pictures.  I'd like two\nversions of the bio.  One is a one paragraph version which will be\ncontained on a web page of all directors, and the second is the full\nbio.  I hate to say this, but there is really no rush on this. :)  I'd\njust like to get it done.  Immediately following the board meeting at\nthe end of the month, the Eagle will run a store announcing the board of\ndirectors and corporate officers, so that's the real deadline.\n\nFinally... for all on this e-mail... on Monday, we will begin running\nour first ad.  It is for CNSNews.com.  PLEASE CLICK ON IT.  They and\nGOPUSA.com will be monitoring click-throughs, and I want to make sure we\ndeliver good results.  A few clicks per day would be cool.  They will be\nrunning the ad for the entire month of June.\n\nTake care, and please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nBobby"}, {"mid": 2, "parent": null, "author": "Scholtes, Diana DSCHOLT", "time": "2001-08-31T09:23:45Z", "lang": null, "text": "-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tThompson, Virginia\nSent:\tFriday, August 31, 2001 9:14 AM\nTo:\tScholtes, Diana\nSubject:\tupdate\n\nDiana-\n\n   I have not heard an answer from Gwen yet on those PMA's, but I am working with risk and I have let Fran know that I am looking into this so as not to hit your DPR twice.

The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.\n\n\tTiming.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.\n\n\tFinancing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.\n\n\tOther Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.\n\n\tProcess.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.\n\n2.\tOther parties\n\n\tSue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.\n\n\tWe were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.\n\n3.\tRate Conditions.\n\n\tWe're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.\n\n\tUnder this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.

My only concern is that we should really try to go for a much shorter time period for Oregon.  I would think about 6 months.  After all, that is NWN's attraction.  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months.  Paul, can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board?  Thanks.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKaufman, Paul\nSent:\tMonday, October 08, 2001 6:38 PM\nTo:\tMetts, Mark; Uhl, Jessica; Mordaunt, Kristina; Shapiro, Richard\nSubject:\tupdate\n\nThree matters:\n\n1.\tConference call with Staff.\n\nParticpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE's rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.\n\n\tTiming.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.\n\n\tFinancing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.\n\n\tOther Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.\n\n\tProcess.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.\n\n2.\tOther parties\n\n\tSue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.\n\n\tWe were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.\n\n3.\tRate Conditions.\n\n\tWe're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.\n\n\tUnder this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny).\n\n\tPGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.\n\n4.\tFERC Review\n\n\tWe're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis.

When Mark Guzman originally made these deals he neglected to put in a 35 mw purchase from WWP at $200 for HE 1-6.  He also neglected to put in the 35 mw sale to Wesco at $275.  The PMA shows the cost for the 35 mw purchase from WWP at $200, but does not show the revenue from the 35 mw sale to Wesco at $275.  These changes were put in at the same time on the same day per Virginia.  This is approximately $57,750.\n\n03/22/01--Deal #558190.  David Porter originally put this deal in as a buy from ST-CALI.  The deal should have been a buy from EES.  I changed the counterparty only, approximately 2 hours after the flash.  The charge of $18750 is the entire charge for the deal (25 mws at $125 for HE 1-6).  If I am charged by EES, I believe I should receive revenue from ST-CALI for the expense that went out with the flash.\n\nST-WBOM\n04/24/01--Deal #590753.  Geir Solberg entered a buy-resale for $320 and $30...I corrected this to 320 and 300 for a difference of $20 on 04/27/01.

Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool.\n\nSecond, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices.

Look at Eric Metcalf in\nhis first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.\nTexas players are magic baby.\nNot to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and\nTommy Nobis\n\nI hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend\nLousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.\nAt least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like\noffense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God\nwilling with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of\nOU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.\n\nI guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems\npretty foolish to you now doesn't it.\nThat dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might\nhave a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between\nhow Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night\nshowed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling\nis the best way to describe his play.\n\nCKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store\nbecause you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me\nthe night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You\nboldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since\nall you were ranting was \"tiger bait, tiger bait\" any time I was trying to\ntell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have\nalready done this season.\nThe bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher\nat the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas\nYou =  LSU.\nWell since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not\nfinish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even\nfinish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash\n- or we can work out an installment plan.\nLenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the\nname but know the face).\n\nIt looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of\nTexas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor\nto the east - Lousyanna.\nTexas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3\ntime champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.\nConversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,\nand the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.\nThe last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader\nof the free world.\nThe last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for\nthe next 15 years or so.\nAnd the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are\nno jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna\n\nEven the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only\nprofessional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell\nand Ricky Williams.\n\nHe who laughs last laughs best.\nMan this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.\n\nHook 'Em\n\nVal forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken\nland east of the Sabine.\nThe Truth shall set your people free.\n\nBrian\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

In essence there are 2 steps -\n\nFirstly there is approving the GTCs and the product description. As Justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the  jurisdiction or more particularly the  Enron counterparty. If the decision is to use US law the counterparty would be ENA. In this case an EWS lawyer in Houston would give the signoff to both the GTCs and the product description. (The two are handled together). Conversely if  Japanese law is chosen then the Enron counterparty that would do an OTC trade for that product in Japan would be the counterparty. That I assume would be EJ. Which choice of law and counterparty to use?  It has been the practice to follow the currency. For example in understand  ENA offers  Japanese and Australian weather in USD. There is also a final legal signoff given by Mark Taylor. This is generally a formality as Mark would be primarily concerned that  relevant lawyer has given their OK.\n\nSecondly, each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product. This is done by the lawyer responsible for the product (ie the one that approved the GTCs) as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporated/resident. Hence I would assume you would be approving Japanese counterparties irrespective of whether EJ or ENA is the counterparty.\n\nGive me call\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTimothy, Justin\nSent:\tWednesday, 31 October 2001 5:16 PM\nTo:\tMcBride, Jane\nCc:\tNiesler, Stefan; Minns, David; Aronowitz, Alan; Keogh, Alison\nSubject:\tRE: Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap\n\nThese are created by legal counsel in the jurisdiction of the Enron entity.

The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and a=\nre expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to mod=\nel and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would=\n be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing =\nthe program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out t=\nhe project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to=\n treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob =\nChandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent ha=\ns indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.=20\n\nAs an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into =\na 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells =\nand provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f=\nield.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu=\nlts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s=\npend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 y=\nears of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield=\n well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has c=\nommitted $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to thi=\ns project for a total of $1.5MM.\n\nHalliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that =\nthey would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Hallibu=\nrton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the re=\nason for high return requirement. =20\n\nThe objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a=\nn Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third=\n party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, prelimi=\nnary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b=\netween $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for =\nthe out years. =20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Hayslett, Rod =20\nSent:=09Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM\nTo:=09Gilbert, Steve\nCc:=09Waymire, Dave\nSubject:=09RE: Redfield Deliverability Project\n\nCouple of quick comments.

This proj=\nect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=\ntandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =\nidentifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=\nd.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=\nonomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=\n%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=\n expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=\nears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=\nses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =\nnegative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=\nterested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.\n\nWhat would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=\ns in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=\nnron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.

My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.\n\nHere's a quick recap-\n\n$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.\n$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.\n$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc\n\nThe difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.\n\nOf this, $218 MM relates to-\n\n-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)\n-[$44] MM for 36\" pipe vs 30\" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.\n-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)\n-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition\n-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)\n-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)\n\nWe can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36\" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.\n\nThe remaining $109 MM comes under the category of \"identified risks\".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the \"escalation\" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust."}, {"mid": 3, "parent": null, "author": "Gadd, Eric EGADD", "time": "2001-10-30T09:29:12Z", "lang": null, "text": "In preparation to present offers to APS, Duke, and Panda, the following tasks need to be completed-\n\nJames, Teb, Blair to calculate rates for $911 MM facilities according to the following guidelines-\n\n- Rate matrix based on contract terms of 15/20/25/30 years\n- Project depreciation consistent with contract term\n- Segmented rates (max rate)\n- Levelized\n- Volume allocations: SJ-780k/d; Cal Border-330k/d; Phoenix;500k/d\n- Incremental O&M costs charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; O&M costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.\n- Incremental fuel retention charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; fuel costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.\n- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $25 MM change in cost of new facilities\n- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $2 MM change in O+M re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.\n\nKevin to provide capital structure and cost of debt, cost of equity (in light of recent circumstances) in support of new rate analyses.\n\nEric, Kevin, Lorraine and Michelle to outline commercial transaction structures for APS, Duke, and Panda.

One of the questions he asked was what the ICC=\n could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC cou=\nld commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilitie=\ns, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the othe=\nr utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and=\n opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversel=\ny affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order t=\nhe utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I pl=\nan to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would li=\nke feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into=\n balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to b=\ne prepared to participate.

Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.\n\n-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.\n\n-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.\n\n-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.\n\nThese are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.\n\nAs you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.\n\nFor our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.\n\nI know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday.

I bet women problems won't even phase Ben,\nbut maybe, we can always hope!  Usually you say female\nproblems, and the men run the opposite direction.\n\nI just got finished paying bills!  Boy, do I have a lot\nof them!\n\nI'm anxious to be able to go to the Astros game.  We\nhave tickets for this coming weekend but I won't be able\nto go.  I can't remember when our next regular season\ntickets are since I don't have my calendar in front of\nme.\n\nI'm going to venture out to get my nails done today\n(drive).  I feel pretty good, so it should be ok.  I'm\nsure I am going to be SO READY to come back to work.\nI'm so glad I have email so I can keep in touch every\nday so I won't miss you TOO much!\n\nTell Neil I miss his calls too!  Walking around downtown\nsounds like fun.  It'll be like in New Orleans.  We just\ngo from bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant.\n\nDid Carlos' wife ever have her baby?  When is the\nseminar in Newport Beach.  Can I come with you to assist\nyou?????????\n\nTake care!  Miss you!\n>\n> Well, things are hopping around work!  Dan and I have barely had time to\n> say hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.  I've got\n> several deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with\n> Stuart and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night\n> tomorrow, so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk\n> around the downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.\n>\n> I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell\n> Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave\n> me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.

At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...).\n\nIn this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).

I had previ=\nously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.\n\nI was able to run the build route report with the criteria of \"Starting On-=\n June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated.\" A =\ncheck of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all d=\neals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed =\ndates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ=\nction. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn=\nation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped,=\n and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous=\nly extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou=\nld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (We=\nst Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)\n\nNavigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately exec=\nute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will=\n contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the=\n PSW to acheive the same result.\n\nRouting deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with =\na clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total=\n unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi=\noning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar=\n showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longe=\nr than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error li=\nst gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful to=\nol.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I=\n had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors =\nin Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept s=\ntarting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server=\n 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encou=\nraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they we=\nre routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us=\ner error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with w=\nhat I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more c=\nomplicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on p=\neak non shaped deals only.\n\nThings I did not expect that I liked:\n\nWhen I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when=\n I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells=\n.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler=\n's sheet.\n\nWhat does not appear to be working at this time:\n\nThe physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr=\noperly in routing.\n\nPath Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one s=\nheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati=\non. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, =\nmany rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I canno=\nt find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path =\nconfirmation.\nWhen the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze=\n.

Here is my list.  Please add items\nif I've missed any.\n\n1.  When can TW \"selectively market\" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity\nis on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits\non calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I\nthink we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to\ntalk to one customer is always \"selective\" since there's only one guy on the\nphone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off\nthe list of \"the usual suspects\" we call to pitch a special deal like an\nindex to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick\nanalysis of this issue.\n\n2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open\nseason context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a\ncouple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use\na lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use\npro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?\n\n3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate\ncontracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW\ndiscounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).

I would suggest\nthat we eliminate both these meetings.  I would propose that we replace them\nwith a single  Friday afternoon meeting from 2:30PM to 4:00PM. The business\nunit heads identified above would be invited.  At this meeting, I would\nexpect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed\ndiscussion of opportunities, problems and issues between the \"partners\" in\nthis company.  It would include (i) a review of current DASH's, (ii) a more\ndetailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the \"Hot Sheet\",\n(iii) a more candid discussion around the P&L and tactics required to meet\noverall financial targets and (iv) provide a forum to provide input into and\ncommunicate business strategies between the business units. In other words,\nemploy the goals of the Friday managing director meeting with all the\nbusiness unit leaders represented.\n\nGiven the religious holidays this week, there will be no meeting this\nFriday.

One of my concerns is, if we notify someone that we accept their Voluntary application, but need them to work for the next 3-4 months, the employees' motivation level might be very low which will effect their performance level.  Or perhaps we can build a statement in to the Separation and Release Agreement stating that the completion of their transition of their role needs to be satisfactorily completed to receive the separation pay.\n\nAlso, somewhat related, do we expect to have the involuntary severance plan amended anytime this year?  As I'm working out the next stage of involuntary severance reductions, just need to know if the calculation is likely to change.\n\nThanks Michelle.\n\nCathy\n\nHuman Resources\nEnron Metals & Commodity Corp.\n520 Madison Ave., 28th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nTel: 212-715-5276\nFax: 212-715-5231\nE-Mail: Catherine.Huynh@Enron.com\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tCash, Michelle\nSent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 1:57 PM\nTo:\tHuynh, Catherine\nSubject:\tFW: Enron Metals North America Voluntary Separation\n\nFYI, please let me know if you have any comments.

Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany\nhas been creating.\n\nHowever if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot\nof unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.\n\n\tFrom:  Katherine L Kelly @ ECT                           03/13/2000 10:34 AM\n\nTo: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\nSubject: Re: CES Pool Gas\n\nHey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are\nTCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these\nwere all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that\nCES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like\nthis on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy\nfrom whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.\nChris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right\nnow he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little\nconfused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the\npool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.\n\nWade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's\npool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would\nhave had to nominate it in Navigator.\n\nJoanie - Do you have any insight into this?\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Katherine L Kelly/HOU/ECT on 03/13/2000\n10:14 AM ---------------------------\n\n\tFrom:  Katherine L Kelly                           03/13/2000 09:58 AM\n\nTo: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Robert Superty/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: CES Pool Gas\n\nI'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower\naround here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he\nneeds to set up the corresponding sales and price them.

For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P\nor A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?\n\n4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?\n\nCarol"}, {"mid": 1, "parent": null, "author": "Carol St Clair", "time": "2000-04-14T10:33:00Z", "lang": null, "text": "Tanya:\nI just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.

They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to\nthe \"transfer\" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the\nother party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee\nprovides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.
